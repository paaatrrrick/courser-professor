0:02
all right we're going we're just doing a
0:03
little brief review on gpcrs we were
0:05
asked to map out the gpcr pathway
0:07
basically and so i'll step out here
0:10
where we're at this point
0:12
this is the filming technique called in
0:14
media race
0:16
which means in the middle of things
0:18
this is how someone we start just right
0:20
in the action like the beginning of the
0:21
first star wars pew pew pew what's going
0:23
on we don't know that's just what kind
0:24
of how you started watching this right
0:26
now so what's going on we don't know so
0:28
the first thing we drew here was the
0:30
growth factor versus the protein hormone
0:31
and we asked what the difference was
0:33
between them
0:34
what the relevant difference is and
0:36
we were um
0:38
brought to the idea that growth factors
0:40
act locally and hormones act over longer
0:43
distances and so we have the paracrine
0:45
signaling idea versus the paracrine and
0:49
i'm sorry paracrine signaling being
0:51
local and endocrine being added distance
0:54
then we talked about the first
0:55
constituent here this is the
0:56
g-protein-coupled receptor it goes
0:58
across the membrane seven times
1:01
they're highly conserved in their
1:02
structures
1:03
and they bind to some hormone
1:06
the g protein coupled receptor will then
1:08
activate a g protein
1:10
the next player here
1:12
by default the g protein is bound to gdp
1:16
guanosine diphosphate
1:18
which renders it inert it is not
1:20
biologically active here
1:21
and upon being stimulated by the gpcr
1:25
the gdp dissociates and the gtp comes in
1:28
and binds once the g protein is bound to
1:30
gtp it's activated
1:34
it then goes over here and it
1:36
activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase ac
1:40
which in turn takes
1:41
adenosine triphosphate and converts it
1:44
into cyclic amp here's the bonus
1:46
question when it does this conversion
1:48
from atp to cyclic amp what's one of the
1:51
byproducts here what's the key byproduct
1:58
it's like a
1:59
kpa
2:03
no that's not correct
2:11
okay well particularly what kind of
2:12
phosphate is it just plain old
2:14
p
2:16
i don't like the pi they usually do know
2:18
okay so it's so this is an instance
2:21
where it's not just one so right that's
2:23
just one phosphate we're going from a
2:24
triphosphate
2:26
to a monophosphate right so how many
2:29
phosphates would have had to come off
2:31
and two
2:32
two okay so there's a there's a word we
2:34
use to describe this this double
2:36
phosphate
2:37
this molecule is called pyrophosphate
2:40
or pyrophosphate depending on who's
2:42
saying it
2:45
i guess pyrophosphate
2:48
does that have an h in it i always yeah
2:50
you know what i'm not not important
2:52
enough for me right now
2:56
all right
2:57
um so now we have uh this molecule
3:00
cyclic amp diffusing throughout the cell
3:02
what class of molecule is cyclic amp
3:06
in this case what's it being used as
3:08
here going julia
3:11
oh that looks you look like you're
3:12
raising your hand
3:14
you're just lounging
3:26
when i read to my kids at night joey
3:27
sits there on the couch like this
3:31
i'm not exaggerating and so i look up
3:33
i'm like do you have a question buddy
3:34
and he's like
3:37
but it's like my all my teacher
3:38
instincts are there i'm like you you
3:40
have to you put your hand down then i
3:42
can't handle this
3:44
i don't even know what he's doing like
3:45
he's stretching or something
3:49
cyclic amp
3:52
is a
3:53
secondary secondary yeah you got good so
3:56
let's all say it together secondary
3:58
messenger good and you can abbreviate
4:00
secondary like this
4:02
remember primary secondary tertiary
4:04
quadrature you could a little degree
4:05
sign secondary secondary messenger
4:09
good
4:10
what's cyclic amp do
4:19
last step
4:40
it makes the
4:42
kpa
4:45
i'm just doodling until you get yeah
4:47
what'd you say it makes what
4:49
the kpa like i forget the actual word of
4:51
it oh oh you got the right letters
4:53
they're in the wrong order though you
4:55
almost got it there
4:58
like pka like the acid one
5:02
oh oh oh pka like yeah so protein kinase
5:07
a
5:08
pka
5:11
zack i like that that's how you can
5:12
remember the like peak i think pka
5:17
so protein kinase a good so this is the
5:20
kinase activated voice that they can't
5:21
be and then what does it do it or
5:23
whatever it does it
5:25
that's that's the door that's closed
5:26
where you hear all the noise behind it
5:28
it's okay
5:33
right so this this
5:35
when you step back and look at this now
5:36
right here so ready i'll draw it one
5:37
more time in a succinct way we got
5:41
one two three four five six seven
5:43
we have a g p c r
5:47
we have a peripheral
5:49
g protein
5:54
we have
5:57
adenylyl cyclase
6:04
and we have protein kinase a
6:14
there
6:15
and then the little key players here we
6:17
have our primary messenger our hormone
6:20
our signaling molecule our ligand
6:23
whatever you want to call it
6:24
we have our gdp
6:28
and our gtp
6:30
and our
6:32
atp
6:34
and our cyclic amp
6:37
and then our
6:39
pyrophosphate
6:41
okay so the way you do this is you just
6:44
literally you just draw it out a few
6:46
times while being mindful about it
6:49
and once you have it in your head
6:52
it almost never leaves
6:54
once it's there
6:56
okay try writing it backwards and
6:58
forwards
6:59
starting with protein kinase say in
7:01
reverse go back
7:02
right it's kind of like can if you can
7:04
see the alphabet backwards you know your
7:05
alphabet
7:07
i cannot say the alphabet backwards
7:10
without thinking through it very very
7:12
slowly but i've heard people just be
7:13
able to rattle it off like the forward
7:15
way and that just bothers me
7:19
like z
7:21
y
7:23
alright that's how i do it that's the
7:24
only way i could do it
7:26
but right i have that in my head so this
7:28
is the same thing this is an alphabet
7:33
this is a self-contained
7:36
module
7:38
that's how i want you to see this
7:40
this
7:41
this is all
7:43
together
7:44
not physically functionally this is a
7:47
functional self-contained unit in other
7:48
words we can pop this out
7:50
in theory
7:52
and put it over here
7:53
in a different cell for a different
7:55
purpose
7:58
right this is
7:59
a basic functionality of higher level
8:01
eukaryotic cells remember that's the
8:03
first time i've said this to higher
8:04
level cells
8:06
not superior
8:08
way more evolved
8:11
okay
8:12
when we it it's it's a dangerous word
8:15
it's a dangerous phrase to say higher
8:17
order animals or higher order plants
8:20
because it suggests that they're
8:24
superior
8:26
okay they're not
8:28
and if you think they are
8:30
try living without oxygen for a little
8:32
while and see how you do and compare
8:33
yourself to an anaerobic bacteria
8:35
right
8:37
it depends on the environment
8:40
okay
8:42
and that's all i'll say about that
8:43
that's that's our chapter 11 song and
8:45
dance
8:47
now my question to you guys is do you
8:48
want me to stop this video do you want
8:50
to keep this as a little chunk and then
8:52
have a bigger video yeah so okay you
8:54
guys
8:54
let's do that so i'm going to stop this
8:56
video now or any other questions on this
8:58
topic before i stop it anything else
8:59
worth
9:01
digging into
9:03
all right here's so here here will be my
9:04
last question then
9:06
what are the other two common
9:08
eukaryotic
9:10
signal transduction pathway strategies
9:13
this was gpcrs what are the other two
9:19
just their names
9:30
signal transduction and cellular
9:33
response okay so that's that's the topic
9:36
signal transduction
9:38
so so gpcrs the gcpr pathway would be
9:41
one way that we can do signal
9:43
transduction to elicit a cellular
9:44
response what are the other two ways
9:46
i see a chat bubble pop up here we got
9:49
okay good april said ion channel
9:51
receptor excellent that's one of them
9:54
i'm trying to write with a highlighter
9:57
ion
9:59
channel
10:01
the other one is like thai
10:03
tyron something
10:07
our buddy tyron
10:11
you got that word's in there sort of a
10:14
word that sounds almost like that so the
10:15
word the word that you're thinking of is
10:17
tyrosine
10:21
what is tyrosine
10:22
tori
10:25
um
10:27
isn't it like an enzyme
10:30
nope the thing we're talking about here
10:34
has enzyme activity tyrosine itself
10:37
is
10:39
one of 20
10:40
[Music]
10:41
amino acids amino acids sorry so
10:43
tyrosine is a specific amino acid within
10:45
the chain of a polypeptide
10:48
okay and so what are the other two words
10:50
i put two blanks there
10:52
blank tyrosine blank
10:57
taken tailor
10:59
kinase
11:00
okay where's that
11:01
at the end
11:03
okay good kinase
11:05
and what's the first word
11:06
receptor excellent
11:09
right so we got receptor tyrosine
11:10
kinases otherwise known as rtks
11:15
we got ion channel receptors and gpcrs
11:20
there are others but these are the three
11:23
biggest groupings
11:25
that we come across when we study this
11:27
stuff
11:28
okay
11:33
very good
11:34
so when we talk about like
11:37
the um signal transduction and cellular
11:40
response
11:41
you said those are like top broader
11:43
topics
11:46
i said what
11:47
didn't you say there were like broader
11:49
topics of like
11:53
yeah yeah so so signal
11:57
transduction
12:00
pathways
12:02
include
12:04
rtks
12:06
ion channel
12:08
receptors and g-protein-coupled
12:10
receptors so these are three broad
12:12
categories of signal transduction
12:14
pathways within each of those are
12:16
specific pathways for example there's
12:19
the estrogen pathway which is a steroid
12:21
hormone which isn't one of these three
12:23
there's the beta and
12:25
beta
12:26
andronergic pathway which is one of the
12:29
gpcr pathways
12:30
okay there's the insulin response
12:32
there's so there's there's literally
12:34
thousands of these different
12:36
signal transaction pathways and so what
12:39
we're doing
12:40
not we but researchers are are
12:43
picking them apart to understand how
12:45
they work so we can see how they play
12:48
roles in various pathologies
12:50
one of the most common pathologies that
12:52
these things are affected with is is
12:54
cancer
12:55
but
12:57
many many many diseases
13:00
can ultimately be traced to problems in
13:03
one of the players in a signal
13:04
translation pathway
13:07
whether it's a non-functional receptor
13:09
or a hyper functional receptor
13:12
or
13:13
protein kinase mutations in these
13:15
various molecules that can cause
13:18
problems right so the more complex the
13:20
system
13:21
the more complex your problems are
13:24
all right there's a saying that we
13:26
parents have that i learned a couple
13:27
years ago where you talked so like when
13:29
my kids were little and i would talk to
13:32
parents of children uh that were
13:33
teenagers the parents had the saying
13:36
little kids little problems big kids big
13:39
problems
13:41
like be thankful that the biggest
13:42
problem you have is your kids are
13:43
fighting over the nintendo switch
13:46
you know it's not oh i have to go to
13:47
jail and pick my kid up whatever
13:50
big problems so complex systems complex
13:53
problems simple systems simple problems
13:56
good
13:58
all right i think that that's milk in
14:00
chapter 11
14:01
for all it's worth at that point
14:03
i'm gonna um
14:05
i'm gonna stop the recording here
