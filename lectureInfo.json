This is what I call my lecture zero this so this material is\nAndrew Ippolito: For context. There's some of this stuff is in Unit one chapter one. But, uh, this is me. This is what I think every Science major needs to understand\nAndrew Ippolito: So the first thing I want to do is give you a little story here. I call this the little horseshoe crabs that didn't\nAndrew Ippolito: So why don't today's horseshoe crabs look almost exactly like fossils from on this case, this fossil right here, dated about 200 million years old.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you look carefully, it has the same basic structure as the modern horseshoe crabs. So the picture on the left is from 200 million years ago. And the picture on the right was from like last Saturday. I don't know. I didn't take it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's how the story goes, Hey, have you ever wondered what's beyond that doing over there said one horseshoe crabs to another.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, not really. Andrew Ippolito: The end.\nWhat's going on here. Andrew Ippolito: So why hasn't the horseshoe crabs. Andrew Ippolito: Are changed."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"The Little Horseshoe Crabs That Didn't","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito tells a story about horseshoe crabs and discusses why they haven't changed over time.","start":"1:18","end":"5:04","content":"What's going on here. Andrew Ippolito: So why hasn't the horseshoe crabs. Andrew Ippolito: Are changed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good Victoria. victoria bloemker: I was gonna say I'm trying to put it on my laptop instead of my phone because it's really hard to see because the screens tiny\nvictoria bloemker: Yeah, so if you see two of me like on it. I'm just trying to switch on Andrew Ippolito: Okay, go ahead.\nvictoria bloemker: Do what you gotta do. Andrew Ippolito: So somebody Angela Harbeck: I think\nAngela Harbeck: I would think that they didn't evolve, because they didn't need to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Go ahead, God, what was like, I didn't mean to interrupt you keep talking. Angela Harbeck: No, I just said it wasn't necessary for them to like go over there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Exactly their environment didn't change right they were never stressed the horseshoe crab is a living fossil and for context this creature\nAndrew Ippolito: has witnessed the rise and fall of the Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs didn't evolve and then they did evolve and then they stopped existing all in his life span, not the same ones lifespan, but you get the point. Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So all that evolution happened and the horseshoe crabs was like kids these days with their, their legs and their their their lungs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. What's up with all man just, I'm just going to enjoy my intertidal zone and just just hang out and relax.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because honestly, the intertidal zone itself, while the position of it might have changed dramatically over the last two or 300 million years, the actual environment itself is kind of the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's the take home in order for change to happen. You absolutely need to introduce stress into the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so here's, here's the allegory. Now, you guys have decided to go over the next dune and see what's what you're getting your education.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. You didn't have to do this. You could have stayed home, you could have done something else with your life, you can go work it. I don't know Cosco they have a good you know\nAndrew Ippolito: They have decent salary and good benefits right but you want more.\nAndrew Ippolito: You want to evolve. Now it's not evolution in the classical sense right well learn something this semester. And that is one of the hallmarks of life is this, this idea that populations evolve over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right individuals don't adapt to the environment. Individuals respond to the environment. We can acclimate to the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we can't evolve. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so that's not what we're using this phrase, we're using the word evolve in the way we use it in more of a sociological concept which is our brain evolves we we change over time. And the only way to do that is to stress yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so stress is a good thing. A little bit of stress a moderate amount of stress will cause change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we're going to learn about metabolism and homeostasis. Soon the idea you're if you're cold. What do you do you go somewhere where you're not cold or you put a shirt on, or a jacket on, or whatever you change something so that the stress goes away.\nAndrew Ippolito: You're going to study until you understand something. So you're not stressed about it anymore. They see how it works. You being stressed is a signal that something has to change so that you're not stressed anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: And chronic low grade stress, which is what education is causes continual change and improvement. So what I tell my students is, don't be a horseshoe crabs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, I wasn't sure which picture to show this one or the much more interesting."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"The Importance of Stress for Change","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the role of stress in driving change and improvement.","start":"5:04","end":"6:40","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right, I wasn't sure which picture to show this one or the much more interesting.\nAndrew Ippolito: Somebody made a horseshoe crabs costume. Jordan Russell: I'm not gonna lie I went ahead and I looked at the PowerPoint earlier in the class cracking up looking at that picture.\nAndrew Ippolito: When I first saw it. I was a little disturbed by it. It's like somebody passed out in a horseshoe crabs outfit. Right. They just fell over. But then I realized, no. That's how horseshoe crabs wrote you know roam the earth. So he's probably fully conscious and just shown off his costume.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, we kind of want to put this on a shirt though. Don't be a horseshoe crabs. That's our motto for the class right\nAndrew Ippolito: Now I have had other students and other semesters. Tell me, in response to that question.\nAndrew Ippolito: They didn't want to change. If it ain't broke don't fix it. They're comfy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's true. If you have a good life and you don't need an education and you're not curious about what's beyond the other doom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Don't stress yourself out be horseshoe crap. But this is not the place for that this is beyond the dune that's where you are right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. And some of you might be like, you know, I really don't like this side of the dude. I'm going to go back to the other side of the dude.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's fine too. That's part of what freshman year in college is all about is finding what you like. You don't like and what you want to do what you don't want to do\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, it's not successes and failures. It's learning about yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, now I'm going to blow your mind a little bit kind of want a fanfare here."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"Knowledge and Understanding","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the concept of knowledge and its different forms.","start":"6:47","end":"7:57","content":"Andrew Ippolito: What do you know\nAndrew Ippolito: So knowledge itself. This is what we're going to start to talk about soon knowledge itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a Andrew Ippolito: Well, first of all, it's within the realm of philosophy called episode homology. Maybe you've heard that word before\nAndrew Ippolito: Episode homology is literally the study of knowledge. And so we're going to learn for context here.\nAndrew Ippolito: The different ways that a human being in our little noggin here how we put new knowledge in\nAndrew Ippolito: There's different ways to do that. Andrew Ippolito: And we'll see how science fits into that. All right. But before we can even think about knowledge. Let's get a really intuitive understanding and let's give ourselves a perspective here and the universal scale.\nAndrew Ippolito: To just really hit home the idea that we still know nothing as much as humans have learned we know nothing.\nAndrew Ippolito: On average. The average out the numbers. It's like 00 like point oh there's a whole bunch of O's. They're, they're really zeros to 1% of nothing.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"The Scale of the Universe","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the different scales of the universe and the structure of matter.","start":"8:12","end":"15:34","content":"Andrew Ippolito: We're going to see here. We're at the scale of one times 10 to the six\nAndrew Ippolito: Meters or 100 Adam meters. Andrew Ippolito: This in itself is still a huge number in the sense that the smallest amount of space. If we took a three dimensional, you know, just some violent space.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we asked a question, what's the smallest distance that space can exist in our universe that number, something like 10 to the negative 24th.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's called the punk length as the smallest anything can get\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, what's 10 times smaller than that. There is nothing. And that starts with your, your brain starts to hurt at this point. And that's okay. So we have to step back a little bit. Alright, so we go from one times 10 to the negative 24th to one times 10 to the 16th.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, now I want you to make sure you understand what this means, when we say one times 10 to the zero. What's that, what's that equal to you, like, why are we doing math this biology. It's all connected. What's that, what's the answer that.\nZachary Lucas: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Yeah, exactly. Just one right Zachary Lucas: We just set that equal to one.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. One times 10 to the one. What's that\nAndrew Ippolito: Just shout it out. You know 10 Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and one times 10 to the two is 100\nAndrew Ippolito: Etc. Right. So when I say tend to the second and I compare that to tend to the third. I want you to understand that that's 10 times bigger. That's $1 bill versus a $10 bill. This is $100 bill.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is $1,000 bill, you're like, Oh, I like that $10,000 bill.\nAndrew Ippolito: Hundred thousand dollar bill million dollar bill. I think I want to hold on a second here. Now this is 100. This is a million. Right. So the point is this, even though that that exponent is just going up by one right don't see that as a for something that is 1000 or 10,000\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. So when we say Andrew Ippolito: One times 10 to the negative 24th one times 10 to the 24th is the planck length and the picture you're seeing right here is 10 to the negative 16th.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay 16 to 2417 oh by the way what I can't do math and be social. At the same time, my math skills are terrible when I'm teaching. I just have to warn you about that. So let's see me. Pretend you're not there for a second and 17 that's about seven right 16 that's 48 so\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a difference of Andrew Ippolito: 12345678\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, there's a there's 10 million Andrew Ippolito: Levels are what are called orders of magnitude in between the absolutely smallest scale of the universe and the smallest thing. We know exists.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so just there's there's entire universe is hidden in there. Andrew Ippolito: Alright so this thing right here. What we're looking at is this artist's rendition of what we call a quark.\nJeong Lee: Right. Andrew Ippolito: These are things that you should be learning about in chemistry. I don't think they're learning, you're not learning the Standard Model yet and chemistry. This is called the standard model.\nAndrew Ippolito: You should understand this as a science person, the standard model is there is the best\nScientific Andrew Ippolito: Theory that humanity has ever come up with. It's the most accurate in terms of what it can predict\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we get experimentally. This is physics and chemistry. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the standard model explains our everyday world of atoms and energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it includes Andrew Ippolito: Basically to physical kinds of\nAndrew Ippolito: Particles and they're called quarks. Andrew Ippolito: And they're called leptons.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's what our universe is made out of course and leptons. The leptons include the electrons, which is there is your electron. Okay, so you have and then quarks come together to make protons.\nJeong Lee: And neutrons. Andrew Ippolito: And these are the things that you're familiar with from your basic chemistry.\nJeong Lee: Even if you didn't take chemistry since Andrew Ippolito: High School. You've all heard of protons, neutrons and electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. But what you've learned in the past and what most of your teachers are not telling you is that these are just three of many things and the fact that protons. You've always learned are actually single things. They're not. They're actually systems of quirks.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's three of them in there. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so a quark.\nAndrew Ippolito: I'm just going to give you the the the kindergarten version of this. Andrew Ippolito: Quarks don't come\nIn Andrew Ippolito: Charges. They come in flavors.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if these words are weird to you, they should be okay. The word quark was actually used it was barred from Lewis Carol's Jabberwocky.\nAndrew Ippolito: Talking about something that was weird and nonsensical because when scientists first discovered these things they were weird and nonsensical. And so they gave them nonsensical names.\nJeong Lee: Like the quark. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: There's the up cork. Andrew Ippolito: And there's a down quark.\nAndrew Ippolito: To ups in a down, give you a proton. Andrew Ippolito: To downs and enough give you a neutron\nAndrew Ippolito: Call quarks have charges. Andrew Ippolito: In addition to their flavors. Jeong Lee: Their charges come in thirds though they're either\nAndrew Ippolito: One third or two thirds and when you and I'm not going to give you the, the numbers. I'm just going to say that when you add these together, you get plus one.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you add these together, you get zero. There's your charge of a proton being plus one and your charge of a neutron being uncharged because of the nature of the quarks charges.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK. And then beyond the scope of what I'm going to talk about. There's also something called\nAndrew Ippolito: It's called color charge Andrew Ippolito: And they can either be red. Andrew Ippolito: Or green. Oh my gosh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Red, blue and green. Andrew Ippolito: The primary No no no no no red, green, yellow, red, blue,\nAndrew Ippolito: And so when you add these all together, you get white, just like in color right yeah those three colors together of light, you get white light.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's why you need three of them. So you need the equivalent of a red, green and blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you're like, Okay, what is this is crazy. That's it. You just need to know that these crazy things exist, we're never going to get a test question on this or a quiz question. It's just. Hmm. OK. So now when you think of a proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to think of them like this to ups and the downs, or two downs and and up for a neutron that's protons and neutrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: They're not what you would call elementary charge elementary particles. Their, their conglomerates.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yeah. Andrew Ippolito: We're gonna zoom out now. Andrew Ippolito: And every picture you see here is 10 times bigger than the last picture.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the last picture that we saw is going to be in the center here. So we're still well within"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"Form Follows Function","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the relationship between structure and function in the universe.","start":"15:34","end":"26:21","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And the last picture that we saw is going to be in the center here. So we're still well within\nAndrew Ippolito: quark land here where within a proton one centimeter Andrew Ippolito: Going to zoom out again. Andrew Ippolito: 10 times and here we are in the nucleus of an atom of carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can see that there's some dark purple and some Jeong Lee: light purple. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's your protons and neutrons. The reason why you need both. If there's something you've probably never considered before. If I have two protons, a plus one charge each and they're near each other. What do they do.\nAndrew Ippolito: What's the relationship like they repel. Andrew Ippolito: Right, like charges repel. Unlike charges attract.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now, and you, you probably known that since third grade. Andrew Ippolito: But what your brains. Never done probably is asked the question, How on earth are these plus chargers not blowing up.\nAndrew Ippolito: How is carbon stable. You just told me that they fire Part one there close together, and we know that Carbon has six of those in the nucleus, a carbon has a plus six.\nAndrew Ippolito: The nucleus is plus six. There's six protons in there. That's what makes it carbon\nAndrew Ippolito: But why isn't it blowing up. Andrew Ippolito: And the answer to that. I'm going to reveal here. If this is a proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is a proton. Andrew Ippolito: This is the neutron that's neutral charge the neutron doesn't repel the protons. So they have like a bouncer and between them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. And so you've all learned about the electromagnetic force.\nAndrew Ippolito: Electromagnetism that's the force that's mediated by things called photon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright so photons. Andrew Ippolito: Are particles that carry your force called the electromagnetic force. The force carriers. They're not matter. Their energy\nAndrew Ippolito: There are other forces in the universe, you're already familiar with another one we called gravity. We still don't understand gravity works that's beyond the scope of what I want to talk about. But there's two others. So there's four forces of nature.\nAndrew Ippolito: These other two generally don't learn about in a basic science course. Anybody know them. Has anybody learned about these yet.\nZachary Lucas: Like the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. Andrew Ippolito: Awesome, a strong fortunate week for us. That's the easiest way to think\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: These things also have particles that carry their forces the strong forces particle. Anybody know what it's called.\nAndrew Ippolito: It's called the glue on Andrew Ippolito: Which is named appropriately.\nAndrew Ippolito: The glue on is what glues together the neutrons and protons and neutrons and the neutrons and approach on the protons, anything that's in the nucleus protons and neutrons are stuck together by a force of nature stronger than gravity and\nAndrew Ippolito: Stronger than electromagnetism and it's appropriately named the strong nuclear force because it only exists.\nAndrew Ippolito: Nucleus. It exists over a very short distances. We can't experience it out here, beyond the scope of atoms, which is why you don't usually think about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is high energy particle physics. Andrew Ippolito: Stuff, this is this is atomic bombs and particle colliders and the large\nAndrew Ippolito: The Large Hadron Collider. The ELYSEE, Andrew Ippolito: Write something on Google. If you don't know what that is.\nThe ELYSEE, Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's where that force of nature is now the weak force.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is even weirder. And this took me years to understand well enough to teach it. First of all, the force carriers are called the W. There's two of them. There's the W and there's the bows ons.\nJeong Lee: Just a funny name. Andrew Ippolito: And what those guys do is they keep the quarks together.\nAndrew Ippolito: The ups ups and the downs. That's where the weak forces.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's it. That's as crazy as I'm going to get for you. Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's why carbon state that's Andrew Ippolito: Why, any Adam beyond hydrogen can exist.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because the neutrons are there to keep the protons from fighting each other and blowing Andrew Ippolito: This is also what explains radioactivity.\nAndrew Ippolito: If this was, let's say carbon 14\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so carbon 12 rave. We look at carbon 12 that six protons. Andrew Ippolito: six neutrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's an elegant Andrew Ippolito: 12 member dance. They're all jiggling around and it's stable mathematically it's aesthetically pleasing it's happy it's stable if I add two more neutrons here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now I'm dealing with carbon 14 those extra neutrons don't really, it's like trying to draw a seven sided figure. There's something mathematically off about it. And so at some point in that little jiggle of dances with all the forces. Everyone's got something that gets popped out\nAndrew Ippolito: That's radiation in a nutshell. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, let's go on and now\nAndrew Ippolito: Beyond here. We're at one to the negative 13th and we step back and there's, there's the nucleus and the domain of the nucleus is in that bubble\nAndrew Ippolito: And there is nothing out there beyond that, you know, like that's empty space, say, one of the ways we like to say is like matters, mostly empty space.\nAndrew Ippolito: Zoom out again. Watch this. There's still nothing there. Andrew Ippolito: So we just went up 100 times the diameter of a nucleus and they're still\nAndrew Ippolito: No density of any material. Andrew Ippolito: Now what's really there something called the quantum vacuum. There are things popping in and out of existence, all\nJeong Lee: The time Andrew Ippolito: little quirks. It's like, it's like a if you've ever looked, you know, think of seltzer water like the physical the seltzer water. The bubbles are just that's that's what's going on there is crazy stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want to zoom out again and now you're going to finally see what what are Andrew Ippolito: The starry sky or suddenly, where's my background.\nAndrew Ippolito: Each one of those dots, those aren't stars, of course know what you're looking at here is what you would call a probability distribution or probability density diagram. You're looking at where the electrons around carbon probably are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Electrons are like three dimensional vibrating guitar strings. And it turns out all matter and energy are really waves.\nAndrew Ippolito: The vibrations of a field. Andrew Ippolito: Picture the surface of the ocean.\nAndrew Ippolito: during a storm. Andrew Ippolito: The wind everywhere. And you see the choppiness of the waves. Okay, that surface of the ocean, those waves.\nAndrew Ippolito: That you're observing are due to the interaction between the air and the water and the energy in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so all that churning happens. That's all the interesting stuff is. That's kind of what electrons and protons and neutrons and protons are each particle has an associated field.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is called quantum field theory and this is the most accurate theory. This is the most accurate. I can't spell theories story. Oh my gosh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Quantum field theory. Andrew Ippolito: Is the most accurate description of the universe.\nAndrew Ippolito: Everything is a field. You've all heard the electromagnetic field.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, everything's a field. Andrew Ippolito: And our reality, what we are what we look out in space is due to the interactions between these three dimensional fields.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's about as best as I can give you. That's the most accurate description on the universe and it's probably the hardest to get your brain to wrap around. So the electronic field.\nAndrew Ippolito: These vibrational waves, just like in the ocean. But there are 3D and they have all sorts of cool shapes will learn about later. What you're looking at is that the distribution of in a moment in time where it could be\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay so electrons can be best described as probability clouds. They are there 95% of the time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Don't ask me where the or the other 5% nobody knows. They're on break or something.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's where they can fall through walls, and that's something called quantum tunneling. Andrew Ippolito: We're gonna do, man. Again, here's the beginning of it. All I want you all to look at this picture and acknowledge or her\nAndrew Ippolito: There is organization their structure blurrier eyes a little bit, you'll see a density in the middle. And if you're really careful and you pay attention. You might even start to see some lobes here.\nLike a clover. Andrew Ippolito: Okay if I get rid of that now just kind of blurry your eyes and see that density, there is an order there. If that's not just random static\nAndrew Ippolito: And right there. That's the beginning of a concept. We're going to learn all semester. We're going to see that the structure of things in forms its function.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is an intertwined relationship between structure and function and you can also the form and function. The phrasing might want to burn into your head form.\nAndrew Ippolito: Follows function. Andrew Ippolito: And this is true, all the way down to the individual Adam and all the way up to the biggest galactic clusters and everything in between.\nAndrew Ippolito: Particularly in biology, you will learn about this all the time. In other words, what something looks like informs you the observer. I'm probably something, it does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if an alien came to earth and picked up a fork. They could probably surmise that it's some kind of eating utensil after studying humans a bit\nAndrew Ippolito: They have to eat their food, they have to pick up their food. They might not want to touch their food. And so they use this thing to stick into the food and put it in their mouth right for too small to really be used as a weapon of war. That's what those sort of things are\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and then the spoon. Looks like it can be some kind of liquid. It's bull shaped it takes, you know, gravity into account so you can put some liquid in it, and then they look at a Spork and they're like, well, now that's just silly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so form follows function. And here we are in the heart of a carbon atom. We're going to zoom out again now suddenly we see DNA something we're going to also learn about all semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: We're now on the scale of and nanometre you've all heard nanotechnology.

We'll just know that DNA does one job. It stores information don't teach you all about how it does that later going to zoom out again. Now we can use mesh of DNA. It's almost like a chain link fence.\nAndrew Ippolito: 10 nanometers. What we're looking at here is the wave buyers DNA can be spread out an organized within the caps ID of the wires.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's different kinds of viruses. Andrew Ippolito: Chapter 19 and your book is all about viruses. If you're interested in viruses, for some reason, like, I don't know if you're living during the worst pandemic of a generation or two.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you want to know a little bit more about viruses go over your chapter 19 which is not officially covered in our, in our\nAndrew Ippolito: In our curriculum. If you want to take my microbiology class, you can learn about viruses more in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: In any case, there's DNA viruses. There's are any viruses. There's double stranded DNA. There's double stranded RNA, they're single stranded DNA their single stranded RNA and within the single stranded RNAs there's pluses and minuses. The coronavirus is a positive RNA wires.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the virus itself is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 19 sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry source code to\nAndrew Ippolito: To distinguish it from the original source code buyers, the one that causes SARS. This is the you would call this the\nAndrew Ippolito: The vector of the disease. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, as an analogy, you have the human immunodeficiency virus.\nAndrew Ippolito: That causes the disease acquired amino acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the source code to virus causes the corona virus infectious disease, discovered in 2019\nAndrew Ippolito: That's what Coach so coven 19 and this is how you formally right it it's not coded there's already kovats\nAndrew Ippolito: They're already covert coronavirus infectious disease. If you look on the back of a Lysol container, you'll see the word coven on it and we're in conspiracy theorists like we've known about this for years. No.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, we, we did not know about this particular version of the disease for years we have known about Corona biases for years and epidemiologists have been clamoring for the last 20 years saying that this was going to happen and. Nobody listened to them.\nAndrew Ippolito: There was a paper from 2003 that I read back in March that said that bats in China have a very large repository of Corona viruses and it's only a matter of time before they are unleashed. Yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's a whole bunch of people saying, I told you so. I'm sure they're not saying that that's kind of rude at this point.\nAndrew Ippolito: I'm sure there's a couple. There's always a few of those cantankerous scientists anyway. So this is a double stranded DNA virus, and we're going to zoom out again.

I call this the little horseshoe crabs that didn't\nAndrew Ippolito: So why don't today's horseshoe crabs look almost exactly like fossils from on this case, this fossil right here, dated about 200 million years old.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you look carefully, it has the same basic structure as the modern horseshoe crabs. So the picture on the left is from 200 million years ago. And the picture on the right was from like last Saturday. I don't know. I didn't take it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's how the story goes, Hey, have you ever wondered what's beyond that doing over there said one horseshoe crabs to another.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, not really. Andrew Ippolito: The end.\nWhat's going on here. Andrew Ippolito: So why hasn't the horseshoe crabs. Andrew Ippolito: Are changed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good Victoria. victoria bloemker: I was gonna say I'm trying to put it on my laptop instead of my phone because it's really hard to see because the screens tiny\nvictoria bloemker: Yeah, so if you see two of me like on it. I'm just trying to switch on Andrew Ippolito: Okay, go ahead.\nvictoria bloemker: Do what you gotta do. Andrew Ippolito: So somebody Angela Harbeck: I think\nAngela Harbeck: I would think that they didn't evolve, because they didn't need to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Go ahead, God, what was like, I didn't mean to interrupt you keep talking. Angela Harbeck: No, I just said it wasn't necessary for them to like go over there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Exactly their environment didn't change right they were never stressed the horseshoe crab is a living fossil and for context this creature\nAndrew Ippolito: has witnessed the rise and fall of the Dinosaurs.

What's up with all man just, I'm just going to enjoy my intertidal zone and just just hang out and relax.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because honestly, the intertidal zone itself, while the position of it might have changed dramatically over the last two or 300 million years, the actual environment itself is kind of the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's the take home in order for change to happen. You absolutely need to introduce stress into the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so here's, here's the allegory. Now, you guys have decided to go over the next dune and see what's what you're getting your education.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. You didn't have to do this. You could have stayed home, you could have done something else with your life, you can go work it. I don't know Cosco they have a good you know\nAndrew Ippolito: They have decent salary and good benefits right but you want more.\nAndrew Ippolito: You want to evolve. Now it's not evolution in the classical sense right well learn something this semester. And that is one of the hallmarks of life is this, this idea that populations evolve over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right individuals don't adapt to the environment. Individuals respond to the environment. We can acclimate to the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we can't evolve. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so that's not what we're using this phrase, we're using the word evolve in the way we use it in more of a sociological concept which is our brain evolves we we change over time. And the only way to do that is to stress yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so stress is a good thing. A little bit of stress a moderate amount of stress will cause change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we're going to learn about metabolism and homeostasis. Soon the idea you're if you're cold. What do you do you go somewhere where you're not cold or you put a shirt on, or a jacket on, or whatever you change something so that the stress goes away.\nAndrew Ippolito: You're going to study until you understand something. So you're not stressed about it anymore. They see how it works. You being stressed is a signal that something has to change so that you're not stressed anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: And chronic low grade stress, which is what education is causes continual change and improvement. So what I tell my students is, don't be a horseshoe crabs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, I wasn't sure which picture to show this one or the much more interesting.\nAndrew Ippolito: Somebody made a horseshoe crabs costume. Jordan Russell: I'm not gonna lie I went ahead and I looked at the PowerPoint earlier in the class cracking up looking at that picture.\nAndrew Ippolito: When I first saw it. I was a little disturbed by it. It's like somebody passed out in a horseshoe crabs outfit. Right. They just fell over. But then I realized, no. That's how horseshoe crabs wrote you know roam the earth. So he's probably fully conscious and just shown off his costume.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, we kind of want to put this on a shirt though. Don't be a horseshoe crabs. That's our motto for the class right\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"Authority","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the role of authority in acquiring knowledge and how it relies on trusting the expertise of others.","start":"5:50","end":"8:15","content":"Andrew Ippolito: They didn't want to change.

But this is not the place for that this is beyond the dune that's where you are right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. And some of you might be like, you know, I really don't like this side of the dude. I'm going to go back to the other side of the dude.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's fine too. That's part of what freshman year in college is all about is finding what you like. You don't like and what you want to do what you don't want to do\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, it's not successes and failures. It's learning about yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, now I'm going to blow your mind a little bit kind of want a fanfare here.\nAndrew Ippolito: What do you know\nAndrew Ippolito: So knowledge itself. This is what we're going to start to talk about soon knowledge itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a Andrew Ippolito: Well, first of all, it's within the realm of philosophy called episode homology. Maybe you've heard that word before\nAndrew Ippolito: Episode homology is literally the study of knowledge. And so we're going to learn for context here.\nAndrew Ippolito: The different ways that a human being in our little noggin here how we put new knowledge in\nAndrew Ippolito: There's different ways to do that. Andrew Ippolito: And we'll see how science fits into that. All right. But before we can even think about knowledge. Let's get a really intuitive understanding and let's give ourselves a perspective here and the universal scale.\nAndrew Ippolito: To just really hit home the idea that we still know nothing as much as humans have learned we know nothing.\nAndrew Ippolito: On average. The average out the numbers. It's like 00 like point oh there's a whole bunch of O's. They're, they're really zeros to 1% of nothing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're going to start here. We're gonna, you know, I'm going to teach you a little bit of introductory concepts. I'm gonna put the chat window up here too, because I see some people. Okay.

What's that, what's that equal to you, like, why are we doing math this biology. It's all connected. What's that, what's the answer that.\nZachary Lucas: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Yeah, exactly.

What we're looking at is this artist's rendition of what we call a quark.\nJeong Lee: Right. Andrew Ippolito: These are things that you should be learning about in chemistry. I don't think they're learning, you're not learning the Standard Model yet and chemistry. This is called the standard model.\nAndrew Ippolito: You should understand this as a science person, the standard model is there is the best\nScientific Andrew Ippolito: Theory that humanity has ever come up with. It's the most accurate in terms of what it can predict\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we get experimentally. This is physics and chemistry. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the standard model explains our everyday world of atoms and energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it includes Andrew Ippolito: Basically to physical kinds of\nAndrew Ippolito: Particles and they're called quarks. Andrew Ippolito: And they're called leptons.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's what our universe is made out of course and leptons. The leptons include the electrons, which is there is your electron. Okay, so you have and then quarks come together to make protons.\nJeong Lee: And neutrons. Andrew Ippolito: And these are the things that you're familiar with from your basic chemistry.\nJeong Lee: Even if you didn't take chemistry since Andrew Ippolito: High School. You've all heard of protons, neutrons and electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. But what you've learned in the past and what most of your teachers are not telling you is that these are just three of many things and the fact that protons. You've always learned are actually single things. They're not. They're actually systems of quirks.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's three of them in there. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so a quark.\nAndrew Ippolito: I'm just going to give you the the the kindergarten version of this. Andrew Ippolito: Quarks don't come\nIn Andrew Ippolito: Charges. They come in flavors.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if these words are weird to you, they should be okay. The word quark was actually used it was barred from Lewis Carol's Jabberwocky.\nAndrew Ippolito: Talking about something that was weird and nonsensical because when scientists first discovered these things they were weird and nonsensical. And so they gave them nonsensical names.\nJeong Lee: Like the quark. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: There's the up cork.

I'm just going to say that when you add these together, you get plus one.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you add these together, you get zero. There's your charge of a proton being plus one and your charge of a neutron being uncharged because of the nature of the quarks charges.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK. And then beyond the scope of what I'm going to talk about. There's also something called\nAndrew Ippolito: It's called color charge Andrew Ippolito: And they can either be red. Andrew Ippolito: Or green. Oh my gosh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Red, blue and green. Andrew Ippolito: The primary No no no no no red, green, yellow, red, blue,\nAndrew Ippolito: And so when you add these all together, you get white, just like in color right yeah those three colors together of light, you get white light.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's why you need three of them. So you need the equivalent of a red, green and blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you're like, Okay, what is this is crazy. That's it. You just need to know that these crazy things exist, we're never going to get a test question on this or a quiz question. It's just. Hmm. OK. So now when you think of a proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to think of them like this to ups and the downs, or two downs and and up for a neutron that's protons and neutrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: They're not what you would call elementary charge elementary particles. Their, their conglomerates.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yeah. Andrew Ippolito: We're gonna zoom out now. Andrew Ippolito: And every picture you see here is 10 times bigger than the last picture.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the last picture that we saw is going to be in the center here. So we're still well within\nAndrew Ippolito: quark land here where within a proton one centimeter Andrew Ippolito: Going to zoom out again. Andrew Ippolito: 10 times and here we are in the nucleus of an atom of carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can see that there's some dark purple and some Jeong Lee: light purple. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's your protons and neutrons. The reason why you need both. If there's something you've probably never considered before. If I have two protons, a plus one charge each and they're near each other. What do they do.\nAndrew Ippolito: What's the relationship like they repel. Andrew Ippolito: Right, like charges repel. Unlike charges attract.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now, and you, you probably known that since third grade. Andrew Ippolito: But what your brains. Never done probably is asked the question, How on earth are these plus chargers not blowing up.\nAndrew Ippolito: How is carbon stable. You just told me that they fire Part one there close together, and we know that Carbon has six of those in the nucleus, a carbon has a plus six.\nAndrew Ippolito: The nucleus is plus six. There's six protons in there. That's what makes it carbon\nAndrew Ippolito: But why isn't it blowing up. Andrew Ippolito: And the answer to that. I'm going to reveal here. If this is a proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is a proton. Andrew Ippolito: This is the neutron that's neutral charge the neutron doesn't repel the protons. So they have like a bouncer and between them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. And so you've all learned about the electromagnetic force.\nAndrew Ippolito: Electromagnetism that's the force that's mediated by things called photon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright so photons. Andrew Ippolito: Are particles that carry your force called the electromagnetic force. The force carriers. They're not matter. Their energy\nAndrew Ippolito: There are other forces in the universe, you're already familiar with another one we called gravity. We still don't understand gravity works that's beyond the scope of what I want to talk about. But there's two others. So there's four forces of nature.\nAndrew Ippolito: These other two generally don't learn about in a basic science course. Anybody know them. Has anybody learned about these yet.\nZachary Lucas: Like the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. Andrew Ippolito: Awesome, a strong fortunate week for us. That's the easiest way to think\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: These things also have particles that carry their forces the strong forces particle.

It exists over a very short distances. We can't experience it out here, beyond the scope of atoms, which is why you don't usually think about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is high energy particle physics.

If you don't know what that is.\nThe ELYSEE, Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's where that force of nature is now the weak force.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is even weirder. And this took me years to understand well enough to teach it. First of all, the force carriers are called the W. There's two of them. There's the W and there's the bows ons.\nJeong Lee: Just a funny name. Andrew Ippolito: And what those guys do is they keep the quarks together.\nAndrew Ippolito: The ups ups and the downs. That's where the weak forces.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's it. That's as crazy as I'm going to get for you. Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's why carbon state that's Andrew Ippolito: Why, any Adam beyond hydrogen can exist.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because the neutrons are there to keep the protons from fighting each other and blowing Andrew Ippolito: This is also what explains radioactivity.\nAndrew Ippolito: If this was, let's say carbon 14\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so carbon 12 rave. We look at carbon 12 that six protons. Andrew Ippolito: six neutrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's an elegant Andrew Ippolito: 12 member dance. They're all jiggling around and it's stable mathematically it's aesthetically pleasing it's happy it's stable if I add two more neutrons here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now I'm dealing with carbon 14 those extra neutrons don't really, it's like trying to draw a seven sided figure. There's something mathematically off about it. And so at some point in that little jiggle of dances with all the forces.

You're looking at where the electrons around carbon probably are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Electrons are like three dimensional vibrating guitar strings. And it turns out all matter and energy are really waves.\nAndrew Ippolito: The vibrations of a field. Andrew Ippolito: Picture the surface of the ocean.\nAndrew Ippolito: during a storm.

That's all the interesting stuff is. That's kind of what electrons and protons and neutrons and protons are each particle has an associated field.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is called quantum field theory and this is the most accurate theory. This is the most accurate. I can't spell theories story. Oh my gosh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Quantum field theory. Andrew Ippolito: Is the most accurate description of the universe.\nAndrew Ippolito: Everything is a field. You've all heard the electromagnetic field.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, everything's a field.

We're going to see that the structure of things in forms its function.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is an intertwined relationship between structure and function and you can also the form and function. The phrasing might want to burn into your head form.\nAndrew Ippolito: Follows function. Andrew Ippolito: And this is true, all the way down to the individual Adam and all the way up to the biggest galactic clusters and everything in between.\nAndrew Ippolito: Particularly in biology, you will learn about this all the time. In other words, what something looks like informs you the observer. I'm probably something, it does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if an alien came to earth and picked up a fork. They could probably surmise that it's some kind of eating utensil after studying humans a bit\nAndrew Ippolito: They have to eat their food, they have to pick up their food. They might not want to touch their food. And so they use this thing to stick into the food and put it in their mouth right for too small to really be used as a weapon of war. That's what those sort of things are\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and then the spoon. Looks like it can be some kind of liquid. It's bull shaped it takes, you know, gravity into account so you can put some liquid in it, and then they look at a Spork and they're like, well, now that's just silly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so form follows function.

You're doing super advanced 3D calculus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your brain is intuitively calculating masses and trajectories and making all sorts of crazy complicated predictions things that would take\nAndrew Ippolito: Artificial Intelligence computer geniuses, a long time to put into a machine and you're just casually playing ball and you're playing ball in the five year old right our brains have really good at this stuff. And that's tenacity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Putting new knowledge in your head, based on just what you think is true. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, now, so it can be true, but this is the least reliable way of knowing things just because it seems to make sense, doesn't mean it is. And this is something that our society now more than ever has to be paying attention to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay and I'm not going to go off on a tangent right now about information literacy just\nRight, just make sense. Andrew Ippolito: rationalism.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the realm of logic and reason I think therefore I am probably all heard that somewhere along the line, right. You've all heard Rene de car, I think, therefore I am.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's a really fun joke. I heard years ago run a car walks into a bar, and the bartender is like, oh, Renee. Good to see ya.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you want a drink and the courses I think not.\nHe disappears.\nAndrew Ippolito: Logic and reason we can use in a very regimented way. For example, we take a premise like Socrates is mortal\nAndrew Ippolito: We take another oh I don't have the list of details here. So you say man is mortal socrates as a man therefore Socrates is mortal\nAndrew Ippolito: That's reasoning. That's a specific kind of reasoning, we'll talk about later. Okay. But that's, that there's no moving parts. There's no experiments. There's just, just your own human brain and our brain's ability to perform this thing we call logic and reasoning.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's rationalism. Andrew Ippolito: You would say, you know, as true.\nAndrew Ippolito: Be as true, or I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You would say Andrew Ippolito: You know, if A then be\nAndrew Ippolito: If B. Andrew Ippolito: Then C. Therefore, if a and these are the ones. Sorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then see if A then see that's new knowledge right there and you arrived at that through logic.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's rationalism. Okay, so a rationalist would be somebody who thinks this is the best way to learn and empiricists will be somebody who thinks direct experience is the best way to learn\nAndrew Ippolito: And then there's science. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's the thing, science isn't a philosophy or a worldview or an alternative to religion. It is a process of acquiring new knowledge. It's a process."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"The Power of Science","chunkSummary":"The professor explains that science is not a philosophy or alternative to religion, but a process of acquiring new knowledge through the combination of empiricism and rationalism.

Andrew Ippolito: Eventually we came up with self theory gravitation theory evolution theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Learn about what this word theory means when we do the scientific method. It doesn't mean what you think it means\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so people so so where do they play some fun quotes just associated so experienced the only source of knowledge is experience Albert Einstein said that\nAndrew Ippolito: That's kind of an absolute isn't there. Right. But it's got to be other sources of knowledge. But no, there's only one is called experience.\nAndrew Ippolito: Put yourself up by your bootstraps, the school of hard knocks. What he's really talking about there is we can sit there in hand wave, but at the end of the day, a scientist goes out and actually looks\nAndrew Ippolito: That's the difference between philosophy and science, philosophy is the thinking and the science is the thinking and the doing\nAndrew Ippolito: That's why we call it a doctor, a philosophy, a PhD, having a doctorate in philosophy means that you learned about some subject to the point where you got to the point where there was no more. You could do you got to the point where you could just start philosophizing about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: But nobody's actually done the experiential stuff. And that's why we call it that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Nick a tip, tip of the hat. The Mark Twain probably seven, a man who carries a cat by the tail learn something we can learn no other way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Cats. Andrew Ippolito: I hate cats.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's one of my sticks, you're gonna see in class. I don't actually hate cats, but you're gonna see all semester I pretend to hate cats, because it's funny.\nAndrew Ippolito: I come up with in a totally unintentional. When I started teaching couple years back.\nAndrew Ippolito: I came up some analogies with cats. Now, I don't like cats, particularly in part because I'm highly allergic to them.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's really what it comes down to. I love kittens. But kittens grow up to be cats.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, show hands, how many of your cat people who are you, Oh man, that's too many\nAndrew Ippolito: Wow, that's like a record. I have to class going to hate anybody in here. How many of your dog people dog people yeah oh yeah okay that's much\nAndrew Ippolito: Better Way more dog people, thank God. Andrew Ippolito: I'm just kidding. Again, I just want to preface.\nAndrew Ippolito: This by saying Jordan Russell: This is all a stick. Andrew Ippolito: I don't actually hate cats. Andrew Ippolito: But it's a funny thing to do. And you'll see when we do like when we do metabolism. I learned about metabolism right you'll see some of my funny catch up here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, holding a cat by the tail and really holding anything by the Toby mean it might give them like hip dysplasia, but particularly, you can imagine, pulling a cat by the tail that's gonna you're gonna learn something.

Andrew Ippolito: Last year I started reading rereading for the first time as an adult 1984 by George Orwell\nAndrew Ippolito: Very disturbing book. Andrew Ippolito: And if all others accepted the lie, which the party imposed if all records told the same tale than the live past in the history and became truth who controls the past ran the party slogan controls the future. And who controls the present controls the past\nAndrew Ippolito: The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final most essential command.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\nAndrew Ippolito: That was it. Literal quote by what time is it Andrew Ippolito: We're missing the presidential inauguration. We missed it was an hour ago. So we can now say our former president said that\nAndrew Ippolito: I just want to preface this by saying this is our first day of class, I am not political in class at all. I respect everybody's worldview. Everybody's philosophies.\nAndrew Ippolito: But there are some things that don't have two sides.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they're beyond the scope of the class. Right, so I I don't have my first amendment rights when I'm a teacher, no teacher has their First Amendment rights.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason for that is very simple. You are what you would call in legal ease a captive audience. In other words, because I give you grades.\nAndrew Ippolito: And because some of those grades, not for me personally, but if you're a hypothetical teacher giving grades for say class participation, or you know grading essays, or whatever. And then like an English class because I have power over you by awarding grades to you.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have the freedom to say things to me you'd like to say maybe because I could in theory penalize you for them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's why I don't have my freedom of speech because you're a captive audience. So instead I have something called academic freedom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Academic freedom is my ability to teach you things that might not be comfy. But if it's within the scope of the curriculum, it's fair game.\nAndrew Ippolito: For example, I can teach you about evolution and because this is a biology class. We can talk about things that are sometimes uncomfortable like death or abortion or\nAndrew Ippolito: Sex and gender the genetics behind those things. Andrew Ippolito: Right. And I'm going to talk about all that stuff this semester. And I'm going to teach you a lot about what the science is behind those things things I can't talk about are things that have nothing to do with the\nAndrew Ippolito: The, the curriculum, so I can't talk about anything that's going on the world unless there's a tie into science. For example, I can talk about the fact there's no such thing as an alternative fact\nAndrew Ippolito: You might have heard that phrase in the last few years. Raise your hand if you've heard that phrase before alternative fact yeah that's\nAndrew Ippolito: That's nice, maybe for a level stuff. That's\nAndrew Ippolito: That's propaganda. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I can talk about the free press Andrew Ippolito: Because we're talking about acquiring knowledge. There are three people three types of fields that people go into where as a professional, their job is facts.\nAndrew Ippolito: Teaching, which is what I'm doing right now. Andrew Ippolito: Journalism, which is essentially the scientific method.\nAndrew Ippolito: And doctors Andrew Ippolito: right to vote, but let's say journalists and teachers and those are the targets of propaganda.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you want to control the message, you have to take away the confidence that people have in the people whose job is to report the facts, teachers and journalists. So education gets lampooned and the press gets lampoon\nAndrew Ippolito: Let's make sense. I hope so. That's authority, though.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. That is the way to acquire new knowledge authority, you're learning that right now. I'm an authority figure"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"The Role of Science in Society","chunkSummary":"The professor explains the importance of science in society and its role in acquiring knowledge.

That is the way to acquire new knowledge authority, you're learning that right now. I'm an authority figure\nAndrew Ippolito: Because I'm a teacher. But how do you know Andrew Ippolito: Can, can these methods that we're using be fallible.\nAndrew Ippolito: How do you even know who I am. It says, Andrea Polina right here. Andrew Ippolito: That must be Andrew Pulido now when I was in school when we're in person. I used to make this really dark joke like how do you know Andrew blue was actually not in the trunk of my car.\nAndrew Ippolito: I didn't know. I didn't kidnap Andrew bleed on impersonating them you have relied on the assumption that the school did all that checking first\nAndrew Ippolito: You're making assumptions. Andrew Ippolito: Now, the key here is, and we're going to talk about the assumptions of science, you have to make assumptions or you just keep having to reinvent the wheel every day.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you have to constantly quality control and validate every single fact all the time. You're not going to build anything new. You're just going to keep reinventing the same thing over and over again.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's no good. So authority when used properly is a shortcut. Your textbook as an authority scientific journal articles are authorities, I'm an authority, you're an authority you learned it from me, now you can go to somebody else.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but you have to keep in mind every source of knowledge has its strengths and weaknesses and authority.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has its weaknesses. Andrew Ippolito: Right, if I'm not a responsible teacher, and I'm not reading up on the current things and I'm making up answers to your questions that I don't know and I pretend I do\nAndrew Ippolito: That's being a responsible. I'm sure there's some people that hand wave but don't tell their students are hand waving and you learn or I miss speak and I see something factually wrong and now you have something factually wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just like Spider man's uncle said with great with great power comes great responsibility.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's authority. Andrew Ippolito: As tenacity. This is my favorite one to just joke about this is a really good quote false hood flies and the truth comes limping after it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Once you put something out into society. It is almost impossible to take it back.\nAndrew Ippolito: We've all been exposed to this sort of thing. Andrew Ippolito: For example, Andrew Ippolito: The whole situation with vaccination right now, which is more important than ever. But go back five years.\nAndrew Ippolito: Go back to the idea that vaccines cause autism. Andrew Ippolito: Which was made up by researchers\nAndrew Ippolito: They admitted it to them. They were lying. They may they fabricated their data and they went to jail for it and they lost their license for it. And yet, there's still people who believe it.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you believe that narrative. Andrew Ippolito: When somebody uses the phrase narrative. Yeah, that's a flag.\nAndrew Ippolito: That that's the conspiracy mind not saying there aren't conspiracies, but I'm saying that for things that science accepts like vaccination does not cause autism. You believe that still you're being tenacious.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Foolish people ask you Andrew Ippolito: When you speak what they do not wish to hear how do you know it is the truth and not an error of your own. We know the truth when we see it from opinion as we know when we are a week that we are a week.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do we end up one Andrew Ippolito: We might end up one Andrew Ippolito: I do this sometimes, especially the first day of class.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yeah, I think we ended one. Alright, so, Give me, give me another minute or two to just wrap this up. And we don't usually go over time it just the first day of class.\nAndrew Ippolito: Um, what's so the idea here is you know it's it's light outside of course it's like, how do I know it's late. Well, it just makes sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually no less empiricism that that's not that's not even like how do I know I'm a week.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because I just feel a week. How do you know your real Andrew Ippolito: Man, that's where\nAndrew Ippolito: That's tenacity here. Let me skip ahead here. Andrew Ippolito: To science.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the status aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. That's the truth.\nAndrew Ippolito: And right now we're gathering more data than we can process. Andrew Ippolito: There's every second of every day we're gathering things like telemetry data and and ocean temperatures and wind patterns and every time in real time right now we're just building these massive data repositories and we don't even know what to do with them yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: We're getting an artificial intelligence to handle that stuff. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. But here's the thing. That's what I wanted to get to, for the end of the class. Science is it's a Venn diagram, you have empiricism. On one hand, you know, rationalism, on the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now I include tenacity and authority here because even though they don't directly relate. We do use them sometimes for inspiration. For example, if you're coming out with a novel hypothesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sometimes it just makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: Differences is that's not where it ends. You're not claiming knowledge there you're claiming the beginnings of an inquiry to seek that knowledge.\nAndrew Ippolito: Likewise you read something in a scientific paper that gives you an idea that's the authority part so they live outside of it, but they're very much\nAndrew Ippolito: The augmented Andrew Ippolito: Okay. The key is this any single individual method of acquiring new knowledge is a week unto itself. It's when you put them together and you get this very robust discipline system. And that's what science is\nAndrew Ippolito: And everybody uses it, whether it's a court of law or in journalism or or doctor, or a construction worker. It's just a method of acquiring new knowledge. It's professional troubleshooting, in some ways, that's it. There's nothing special about it, denying science is denying reality.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. And so I'm going to leave you on this concept because we see things like, well,"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 1) - Perspective, Knowledge, and Science","link":"https://youtu.be/i10TosJLRHA?si=QHfIxlhy-xgcT652","chunkTitle":"Science as a Continuous Process","chunkSummary":"The professor concludes the lecture by emphasizing that science is a continuous process of inquiry and learning.

The thing is, guys, is that\nAndrew Ippolito: This was a new virus, and we were learning things at an accelerated pace. And so here's the concept. I would never want you to forget. And you can start using this one today, you're ready science.\nAndrew Ippolito: I'm going to write this down because it's so important. And I'll leave you on and it's today science.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is replaced Andrew Ippolito: By\nAndrew Ippolito: Better science.\nAndrew Ippolito: We're always inquiring and learning new things and adding to what we knew before and throwing out what was wrong and replacing it with something more accurate.\nOkay, Jordan.

But now we can't eat eggs again and eggs are bad, and eggs are good well\nAndrew Ippolito: That's because we're still learning the week cholesterol works and how that really start disease. Well, and about that went to genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, alright. So that concludes our first day of class. I hope you enjoyed it and what I want to make sure you do now is get everything you know be motivated\nAndrew Ippolito: And let's let's see right now our short term goal is to get everything done get everything set up so that you're kicking butt on on Quiz one\nAndrew Ippolito: Which you're going to have after the second I think by day three, we'll have our first quiz.

This is a Andrew Ippolito: Part two of lecture one, basically, and we we pretty much we covered these guys here. If you recall, we're talking about the kinds of\nAndrew Ippolito: The methods by which humans acquire brand new knowledge okay and and by now. Hopefully you guys have read the handout I wrote that over the last few years.\nAndrew Ippolito: Knowing that notable introductory textbooks give you this stuff. I think they should\nAndrew Ippolito: A couple of the non majors biology books, give us the assumptions of science, which we'll talk about next, but none of them really do epistemology at all. And I think it's important, especially in this day and age when scientific literacy is pretty much like at an all time low.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys rate you. One of the things that Andrew Ippolito: You're going to become\nAndrew Ippolito: Being a science major is you have this burden of responsibility of making sure that the people that you interact with\nAndrew Ippolito: professionally, personally, socially, Andrew Ippolito: That that you're kind of a check on that for society. Now I'm not going to suggest that you should all become stem evangelists and start proselytizing the, you know,\nAndrew Ippolito: The words of science, but you definitely need to be part of the quality control right and that so that includes things like your Facebook or Instagram you're sharing means you got stuff going on in your in your life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Before sharing stuff. You got to kind of Andrew Ippolito: Make sure that there's a confidence there in it. Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's one of the things that we don't have time for these days we'll see something on Facebook or Instagram and we'll get so mad. I can't believe that they did that thing. Oh my god, I'm sharing this and showing everybody\nAndrew Ippolito: And then like three or four minutes later, somebody like that didn't happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's a deep fake or, you know, that's a Photoshop Bernie Sanders can't flow and space in a chair. Come on.\nAndrew Ippolito: We've all seen the memes. By now, I'm sure, to the point where everybody's already fatigued about them. It's kind of like, I think that's a record story arc for a meme. It started everybody at irritated by we're already not doing anymore. It was like three days I was like a record.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some of them are really funny. Andrew Ippolito: But, uh, the point is, my point is, is that as budding scientific minds.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to get how this stuff works. Right. So one of the things I'm going to be teaching you this semester is how to think like a scientist.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and that when I see think like a scientist, you could replace that with the variations of this thinking like a lawyer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Thinking like a journalist thinking like a medical doctor. Okay, you're basically a professional problem solver.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's the secret when you eventually get your PhD is you're a professional problem solver. It doesn't matter what you get it in\nAndrew Ippolito: The fact that you have it means that you did these horrible problem solving things for many years and you are now essentially a professional problem solver.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. And so that's what we're going to learn about so all science is you have to keep this in mind science isn't a worldview. It is not a paradigm of thought. It is not a religion. It's a technique.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's designed to take into account human weakness and human fallacy and our and our logical fallacies in our emotional tendencies, because when it's done right. It's the most accurate way to get through to new knowledge. Okay. And so\nAndrew Ippolito: Once we started doing this in the 1500s. Andrew Ippolito: I mean the the concept of scientific method has been around since about the mid 1200s but it wasn't really implemented.\nAndrew Ippolito: Until about the 1500s, once we started doing it, though. Once the people who were inquiring nature investigating nature started doing it in a systematic way.\nAndrew Ippolito: We started to really get going as as a civilization as a global civilization in terms of our knowledge and acquiring\nAndrew Ippolito: Information on things like probably one of the most important things, science has given us his, uh, his germ theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that that it's not bad air but microorganisms that kill us right epidemics and when we're dealing like what we're dealing with today.\nAndrew Ippolito: The coven 19 pandemic has happened countless times throughout history. This is just the latest so science is giving us the tools in order to conquer these things and not have the same levels of mass devastation that swept through humanity and previous times\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what we're going to do. Now I'm going to skip through these these quotes for now. You can read those on your own. They're just good context to this stuff we're talking about science. Okay. Now, here's the thing. Before you can even start understanding how science works.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are three things, three concepts that are not scientific that you have to assume are true before you even think about science."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 2): Science And Assumptions","link":"https://youtu.be/YsNccORLBZk?si=5_SodyNWAkUiVdW4","chunkTitle":"Assumptions of Science","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains the three assumptions of science: natural causality, universal natural laws, and universal human perception. He discusses the importance of these assumptions in the scientific method and their implications.","start":"5:23","end":"13:59","content":"Andrew Ippolito: There are three things, three concepts that are not scientific that you have to assume are true before you even think about science.\nAndrew Ippolito: These three things are not things that can be scientifically demonstrated. There's no way of proving these things or disproving these things and you don't have to believe in them but\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to assume they're true when you start doing science and the human brain is exceptionally good at putting up walls and silos, so that people can have all sorts of this fun cognitive dissonance and hold two things that seem impossible in their head at the same time.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's okay because we're human, we're not robots. We're allowed to be a little irrational.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to give yourself license for that even as a science person you're allowed to hold thoughts that are not necessarily rational, so I'm not going to sit here and tell you that the first assumption of science, which is called natural causality.\nAndrew Ippolito: The notion that all observable events are due to natural causes. This doesn't say therefore stop believing in God. That's nonsense.\nAndrew Ippolito: This says that if you see something out in the real world. Andrew Ippolito: You have to accept the fact that whatever causes it, the underlying cause of it is something that can be discerned. And at least in theory, we might not have the technology but\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe someday we will Andrew Ippolito: Okay. And the thing is, is if you don't assume this to be true if you assume the opposite of natural causality, which supernatural causality, you could think of it as a God did it.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's fine, but that's the end of the conversation then right i mean you just you just figured it all out. There's, there's no investigation to be had there might be moral complications or you know consequences but\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas the scientific view of natural causality as well hey let's let's figure out what the root cause of this is what causes the high tide to come in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why do we have a super high tide once a month, the springs tides. Why don't we have the nucleotides once a month, super low tides.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it has to do with the moon's pulling gravitation and an elliptical orbit and is also going around the sun. Right. And it's sometimes it's a little more subtle.\nAndrew Ippolito: And sometimes it's beyond the scope of our technology. Andrew Ippolito: The vast majority of the observable universe is still hidden from us. It is still unknown in right now unknowable dark matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: 85% of the stare up at the sky 85% of the cosmos is something we don't even know what it is. It's not protons, neutrons and electrons we know it. We know it pulls gravity.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's right now. Probably the greatest mystery of our generation. Andrew Ippolito: It's what what what is that\nAndrew Ippolito: People working on it. Right. But if we're just like, oh no it's maybe it's God Andrew Ippolito: Maybe dark matter is just like God's hands. Okay, that's the end of the story. Right. So you see, it's not about what you believe, or what you don't believe it's the idea of this is almost the driving force behind our inquisitorial nature's right\nAndrew Ippolito: And again, science only concerns itself with the natural world. The, the stuff that we can directly observe or indirectly observe it has nothing to do it all with spirituality. What happens after life or death. None of that it has to do with what the tangible the concrete.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. So what that tells you is that science doesn't have all the answers. It can't have all the answers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Science can address questions of morality. Andrew Ippolito: Or aesthetics\nAndrew Ippolito: Science can't tell us that it's right or wrong to do something, it can only arm us with knowledge and then being humans and having the context of our own cultures, can we make informed decisions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does this make sense. Good. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. The second assumption of sciences natural laws are universal, both in space and in time.\nAndrew Ippolito: The laws of nature do not change. Andrew Ippolito: Maybe they do. That's exactly what we're talking about right now. Maybe they do but we have to assume they don't or we can do any of our work.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we say things like the Earth is four and a half billion years old and the universe has been 14 point whatever billion years old. We're making those calculations based on the assumption that the data we're gathering and the trends we observe and the data.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are extrapolated from the point where the numbers don't change the rate at which radiation happens radioactive decay of a half life you guys learn your chemistry classes. What a half life is right.\nAndrew Ippolito: That doesn't change people do these experiments. If you take carbon 14 you heat it up really hot or you're cool it down or yeah change its pH.\nAndrew Ippolito: You do whatever you can to it. We can't change the rate at which it deteriorates\nTo grades. Andrew Ippolito: And so in the same way. When we look at, say, the gravitational constant\nAndrew Ippolito: Or the value of an electrons charge right in physics, there's all these constants, there's always things that we can measure\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, how massive something is how much of a pull it has what is charged, blah, blah, blah. Okay, or even PIE NUMBER number first learning that pie is that ratio between circumference of the circle and its diameter and when you cut a circle. So if you take a circle right\nAndrew Ippolito: And you kick a pair of scissors and cut it and then you extended if if the diameter from here to here was one unit of whatever you're measuring and this becomes 3.14 is always the same, no matter what that ratio between that never changes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. One of the fun things that you can start thinking about as well. What if there was a universe where the gravitational constant was 10% a little stronger or 10% a little weaker.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. And it turns out if you imagine the universe where the laws of physics were a little different.\nAndrew Ippolito: We wouldn't have matter, we wouldn't have molecules gravity would crush everything together into the singularity. Again, it was just 10% stronger.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it was 10% weaker, everything would fly apart and nothing would hold each other so so I universe is like the Goldilocks idea. It's just right for humanity.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is called the anthropic principle, the idea that our universe seems to be\nAndrew Ippolito: Designed to be exactly suitable for human habitation. Isn't that interesting.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. We don't know why. Andrew Ippolito: Everybody's got ideas. Here's my take on it. There's an infinite number of universes with an infinite set of these values of things like the\nAndrew Ippolito: Value of an electrons charge and gravitational costs and yada yada yada. And that if you take all of those possible universes. They're just a small subset of them were matter could exist and wearing one of those. And that's why we're here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Hmm. Andrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Then it also tells you what we're all the other universes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe we're sensing their poll and that's what dark matter is maybe the gravitation, we feel is that's us being able to somehow interact with the rest of the multiverse through one of the forces of nature.\nAndrew Ippolito: That would also explain why gravity so weak. There's so many degrees of freedom of it that it's hardly felt. How cool is that\nAndrew Ippolito: Doctor, I think you've been drinking a little bit this weekend. I don't know what you're talking about this a little crazy.\nAndrew Ippolito: heavy drinking lots of water that Andrew Ippolito: These are things that keep me up at night.\nAndrew Ippolito: The third assumption of science is called universal human perception. You got to put the observer in there right without humans. There's no science, but maybe there is but we wouldn't know because we wouldn't be here talking about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the one that distinguishes science and art or aesthetics, the idea that we all perceive the universe and the same way, basically."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 2): Science And Assumptions","link":"https://youtu.be/YsNccORLBZk?si=5_SodyNWAkUiVdW4","chunkTitle":"Characteristics of Science","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explores the characteristics of science, including empiricism, rationalism, communication, falsifiability, reproducibility, and debatability. He emphasizes the importance of these characteristics in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.","start":"13:59","end":"29:55","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This is the one that distinguishes science and art or aesthetics, the idea that we all perceive the universe and the same way, basically.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want to say, basically, or in this case, fundamentally, because here. Well, what about you, you're definitely on here. You don't perceive sound the same way that is true, but that's a pathology.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can poke your eyes out. And now you're blind. Now you would now you just violated that lot. Well, no, I'm talking about all things being equal,\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, read, read. You guys look at my shirt. If I asked you if I pulled the class. What color is dr is shirt you guys and I just gave you three choices. We don't have to play games like that's more of a maroon\nAndrew Ippolito: Red, green, or blue. If I said what color is my shirt. Is it red or green or blue you'd all say read right if I drew on the screen a sheet like this and ice and, you know, okay, let's make sure that, you know, oh, it's not exactly a square, but now it is\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, you tell me that's a square. It's not a circle. Andrew Ippolito: Right. So the idea with sciences.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to assume that all of your fellow humanity is perceiving things in the same way you are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. So look at the right hand side of the screen there. And you can see there's two pieces of art. On the left is like a dark background with some light colored geometrical they look like mostly rectangles.\nAndrew Ippolito: And on the right hand side there's mostly white with like a red and a blue square. Okay, so watch this right everybody look at the screen by a quick show of hands, how many of you agree that what I just pointed to right here is a red square\nAndrew Ippolito: Does anybody want to argue me on that. Andrew Ippolito: I'm open for debate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Nobody's gonna right. So how about this. How many of you think that's a triangle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Raise your hand. That's the triangle right okay these what we're examining now are called facts.\nAndrew Ippolito: A fact is a statement that we accept is true. And you see that definition right there opens arguments up\nAndrew Ippolito: Right in the last four years, the idea, like we can even agree on facts.\nAndrew Ippolito: The word itself is up for grabs. I'll never forget the day I heard the phrase that's an alternative fact\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, sure that those are your facts. These are my there's that is not a thing I just want to make that crystal clear here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You're not. So here's the phrase, I want you to remember and learn, you can use this in arguments. If you want, you are entitled to your own opinions, you are not entitled to your own facts.\nAndrew Ippolito: What my own, but you might triangles have four sides. No, no, that's called that's called a quadrilateral.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whatever that I'm calling a triangle, then you're wrong. Well, that's just your perspective. No, no, that's not my perspective, this is affect\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys see where I'm going with this, right. You can't. There's a baseline. The problem is, is we're all humans and the very definition of the word fat itself means we accept them as true.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so my example of a fact is always and I use this in every conversation. I have now a triangle has three sides. You can't argue that.\nAndrew Ippolito: I've yet to hear somebody present a cogent argument that I am wrong, unless you want to start going into etymology and the derivation of words it but then you're just that summit that's literally semantics and we're not going there either. Okay, so you guys are getting this good\nAndrew Ippolito: Now I'm gonna ask a different question. So let's call this art. A in this art be by a show of hands, how many of you think that a is more aesthetically pleasing then be you like a more than be, raise your hand.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is it like 123456. Okay. How many of you like be more than a\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it's about the other half of the class. That's interesting. All right, so everybody who likes be more you're wrong. Oh, what they know. You're not wrong. I'm just kidding. But that's the point there. And that right there is a difference between art and science.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't be wrong when it comes to aesthetics that no i can be wrong. That's a terrible haircut.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right aesthetics has to do with your previous history and context and the way your eyes work and how you were raised, and the experiences you had\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't tell somebody. They're wrong about art. That's the fun thing about art and that's why there's so much of it. And so different. Everybody's got their own stuff going on and they see beauty is in the eye of the beholder. That's a great phrase, because it's so true.\nAndrew Ippolito: Everybody sees beauty differently. Andrew Ippolito: There's no such thing as objective beauty.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's not what my philosophy professor said they're wrong. Oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe that right. I don't know. Maybe there's objective beauty symmetry is supposedly objective beauty right\nAlexa DePrisco: What about the golden ratio. Alexa DePrisco: We just say let's Alexa DePrisco: What about the golden ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's inherently that is objectively beautiful sure the Fibonacci sequence. There's another one. You guys know the Fibonacci yet you guys learn that quick show of hands Fibonacci.\nAndrew Ippolito: Raise your hand if you've never heard of it Fibonacci what okay just very quickly take a number. Let's start with one you have to start with one. Okay. And then we're going to put another one. We're going to add those together. We're going to get it to\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we're going to take this to. In this one, we're going to add those together and you get three, you see that I'm going to take the three and the two and we're going to get a five.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or we're going to take the five and the three and we're going to get an eight, etc. That's the Fibonacci number sequence. And when we see that nature everywhere. It's kind of crazy.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look at things like the number of petals on a flower.\nAndrew Ippolito: Things like that, though. Like if you count, like a like a triple digit number it's within the Fibonacci sequence usually\nAndrew Ippolito: It's one of those natural things like pie or E. It's a sequence of numbers that we just happened to see over and over again. That's Fibonacci.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: And then the golden ratio, which I don't think I could do this. Why don't you take this, you start in the middle and you kind of\nAndrew Ippolito: Know, I can't do the golden ratio. I can't start you make a spiral where it's always the same distance from itself. Ah.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the ratios of the curves are symmetric like mathematically it's all perfect. So if you look at like the one famous picture I we see out when I was a photographer doing all this\nAndrew Ippolito: Somebody was very long hair in a pool underwater coming up from the pool and whipping their hair back in the water makes this splash curve that curve is a golden ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: And has to do with the way acceleration and gravity works together with moving things it's it's it's so that is one of those. I think\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's say that there are a few things that are generally by consensus accepted as aesthetically pleasing. But beyond that, you know, I like death metal. I like classical whoa okay you know right i mean that's that's what I'm talking about.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so we're going to do now is we're going to go through. So you guys learned all this probably like in third grade the scientific method.\nAndrew Ippolito: observations and experiments. We're going to do the college version of this, you guys are going to look at the little details that were glossed over when you were in like third grade, and you're going to start to see some really cool stuff here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So again, science itself is a blending\nAndrew Ippolito: Of empiricism as a reminder, that's that actually observing directly personal experience using your eyes to get data.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or you know your senses and then rationalism share logic it's blending those two things.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's not just not a squish them together. It uses the best parts of both right. Andrew Ippolito: And so when when it's done correctly, the scientific method accounts for humans fallacies are human fallacies. One of the fallacies. You have to always keep in mind is that humans, including yourself, including me, everybody, we're all humans, we will tend to believe what makes us feel good.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just makes sense. That's that idea of tenacity. Andrew Ippolito: You know, but just doesn't make any sense that.dot.on the points we've all said that we've all thought that we feel it in our bones. Okay. This feeling leads us astray at times.\nAndrew Ippolito: Science takes account of that. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Science requires communication. Okay, it's not science. If you can't communicate it\nAndrew Ippolito: It's a social thing you do it, kind of in solitude, but then you have to share it or it's not science.\nAndrew Ippolito: falsifiable. In other words, the ideas that come out of your methods have to be able\nAndrew Ippolito: To be rendered false. We have to be able to destroy our ideas and be okay with that right there, that's another one of those human things we don't like being wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. How many times have you pointed your finger at somebody looked him in the eyes and say you're wrong. And they said, wow, you're right. I totally agree with that. I'm sorry, said nobody ever\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: But sometimes you're wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just saying that out loud as offensive. Nobody likes being wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: A scientist, therefore it's not beholden to their own ideas are not married to them.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't say my hypothesis. I say this hypothesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because if this is wrong. That's fine. That's great. That means we don't know, something which is exciting. It is my hypothesis went out on the fool because I was wrong. You see the difference there. Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: testable. Andrew Ippolito: When we say testable. That means you have to be able to design an experiment to try to prove it wrong. If the can't be tested not science.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is where we can get into the world of things like pseudoscience.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like intelligent design and homeopathy and water crystals and the, the memory of water and all those fun things that we sometimes hear about\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't test that stuff really Andrew Ippolito: Although to be fair, you can. And we've shown that there's nothing there but those aren't believers. Don't buy any of it. And so to them. It's not really testable.\nAndrew Ippolito: reproducible. Andrew Ippolito: You do an experiment. Oh look, I was able to show fusion at room temperature fusion is when we take Adams and we mash them together and make new elements. And in that process energy comes out of them. So with the sun's doing. That's why it's always blowing up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Doing that on Earth is a little harder. Andrew Ippolito: Because the only way we could do fusion is really hot situations, but if we can develop room temperature fusion will have unlimited energy forever and people are working on that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there was this guy back in the 80s. I still remember this. Actually, there was a front cover of, like, Popular Science magazine. It was cold fusion.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's like the holy grail of energy physics. Andrew Ippolito: And nobody was able to repeat his experiments and he was shown to be, it was all a sham.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you can't reproduce if others can't reproduce your work, it's not science.\nAndrew Ippolito: Communicable and debatable scientists love to be\nAndrew Ippolito: Scientists are not friends with each other. I mean, they are friends with each other, but scientists who work in the same field arrivals.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sometimes Ark rivals. Sometimes they hate each other. There's all these stories of scientists when they go to these meetings. They're like, Oh no Bob showed up. Let's not put those guys in the same table at dinner tonight. They're just going to eat each other alive.\nAndrew Ippolito: hate each other. Andrew Ippolito: Right. There's all sorts of these wonderful examples of scientists on the public forum, just getting you know going at it fighting\nAndrew Ippolito: The we passed or was one of them. He his whole his famous experiments on spontaneous generation disruption disproving spontaneous generation.\nAndrew Ippolito: That was due to a public debate, he had with the guy in charge of the the Science Museum, who said that, you know, spontaneous generations. True.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, it's not. And so they they put up an award and said, Whoever can prove their scientific demonstration that they're right gets the prize and pastor one\nCool story. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's, here's the take home there.\nAndrew Ippolito: If the scientific community. These people who hate each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Comes to an agreement and says, yeah, this thing is probably right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like, like all of them except the one or two who are just ridiculous the outliers.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's probably something that you should put some stuck in that. Notice how he said that I didn't say you should believe it to be true, like, No, you should\nAndrew Ippolito: Like, all things being equal, I should probably be accepted as true for example climate science right now. The idea that the world's climate is changing in a very fundamental way very rapidly. There is nobody in a scientific community who disagrees with that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if there is somebody that you can come across still that disagrees with it. I can guarantee with their paycheck depends on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: The scientific consensus is anthropogenic climate change is 99.99% probable and then we gotta do something about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't have to do anything about it. Hey, wait what we don't Andrew Ippolito: We're not is one of the things that climate size is\nAndrew Ippolito: It's not going anywhere, guys. Andrew Ippolito: We are\nAndrew Ippolito: We're screwed the Earth's looking at us probably me like, oh man, he's poor suckers. I mean, yeah, they even affected me like a virus and there's all this devastation. But you know what, I've had worse.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys remember the meteor that took out the dinosaurs. I do Yucatan Peninsula, I got the score right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's the earth talking Andrew Ippolito: That you guys are nothing. This is just, I mean, I wish you'd get off me already, and just go to Mars or something but\nAndrew Ippolito: But you guys are all having conversations like there's something going to happen to me know you guys are going to be dead. Not me.\nAndrew Ippolito: It's our own quality of life that work that's up for grabs. Right now, the idea the crazy idea that our kids your kids and their grandkids.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are gonna have a shitty or planet than you do. Andrew Ippolito: And they'll have a worst quality of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: The water tastes a little gross and they'll probably get cancer. Andrew Ippolito: Or they'll starve."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 2): Science And Assumptions","link":"https://youtu.be/YsNccORLBZk?si=5_SodyNWAkUiVdW4","chunkTitle":"Introduction","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the importance of science and the possibility of being wrong.","start":"30:02","end":"30:50","content":"Andrew Ippolito: You know, or there'll be some kind of, I don't know, a crazy emergent disease will pop out from somewhere and take over the planet.

Andrew Ippolito: This is a good slide to study. This is a good overview slide. This puts it all out there. Okay. Now, before we even dig into this, I want to say that that theories.

This is the deliverable.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the package. Subject to change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it's outside of the method.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's how it works, humans find something worth talking about some phenomenon, something that makes this golden\nAndrew Ippolito: Gate fun. So fundamentally, this is driven by curiosity.\nAndrew Ippolito: To be fair, sometimes need. Why is everybody dying.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but the idea there is the human mind decides what that is.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we, we make some kind of observation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now this observation here. So here's the like college level version of this. Andrew Ippolito: The observation, you could think of.\nAndrew Ippolito: As data from the last experiment.

Sometimes they fall on our own map. Sometimes they're part of our last work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we take that observation and our brain. We're storytellers. The human brain is a storyteller, by nature, what we do is we take\nAndrew Ippolito: That observation and we immediately start trying to figure out what's going on. We see why. Right. One of the most fundamental questions of the universe. Why\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, so this is now where the rationalism comes in. Andrew Ippolito: We say why we come up with a tentative explanation, a model.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the hypothesis. Andrew Ippolito: You are using reason here and you're not just generically using reason there's a specific kind of reasoning is called inductive reasoning and I need you need to know this.\nAndrew Ippolito: The difference between inductive and deductive reasoning inductive reasoning is when you take something specific like this here observation.

So you're going from a specific thing to a general idea you're going up raise you can kind of draw like maybe like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: You're going to a general concept. Andrew Ippolito: That and inductive reasoning.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're really good at it. Our brains are logical beasts, and in addition to their emotional centers, they have some really good logic circuits.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: This plant is photosynthetic\nAndrew Ippolito: I wonder if all plants are photos and that is the kind of basic idea. Okay, that that's inductive reasoning. Now here's the thing that ID you come up with that thought that. So there's a statement there. So that's another thing hypotheses are not questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the question is part of the process of developing it. The question comes from the phenomenon.\nAndrew Ippolito: What's this thing. I wonder what that thing is this thing is a blank. That's the hypothesis. The statement there. Now here's the other thing that's the hypothesis. When you frame it you want to write it so that it sounds true\nAndrew Ippolito: The sky is blue, because it reflects the ocean. tori bloemker: I have a quick question.\ntori bloemker: Tom good tori bloemker: During the homework assignment. Um, you know how I know one of them has, like, it's like observation hypotheses.\ntori bloemker: Prediction, and so forth. And you have to drag. Which one is correct, like to the box and I always thought like what I learned in high school like hypotheses are supposed to be like if then statements but\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no, there that that is incorrect. Andrew Ippolito: So what you see, you see the next box prediction.\nAndrew Ippolito: And deductive reasoning. That's the tori bloemker: Stuff. Okay. Yeah, because it said that. And I was like, I always thought it was like if then statements for hypotheses, like we were like forced to write them that way.\nAndrew Ippolito: But yet again. Oh. Andrew Ippolito: Yeah, your Andrew Ippolito: Teacher. I mean, not everybody is this deep into the scientific methods that\nAndrew Ippolito: If you were asked going gruff and dirty. You could do that because that kind of skip the step of the hypothesis itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you have to do that what you just said you have to do that next. And so sure. I bet you, you can just take these two and crush them together.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you really want it to be like again at the high school level thinking just, you know, introducing these concepts to students, but so now that's why I said you're learning that college level version of this year.\nAndrew Ippolito: We're going to go into a little bit more Andrew Ippolito: granular detail that's good, though. It's and thank you for telling me that I didn't realize that they were teaching at the high school\nAndrew Ippolito: So yeah, we're going to take.

So the hypothesis itself is a statement.\nAndrew Ippolito: It's not just any statement though God is dead. That's a statement that's not a scientific hypothesis. Okay, to make it the scientific hypothesis here. I want to skip ahead now to make it a scientific hypothesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: It has to have a few characteristics. It has to be falsifiable\nAndrew Ippolito: Able to be rendered false has to be testable and it has to have the power of prediction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here's another here's another you know if you're taking down my quotes here. So it's not science. If it's not predictive\nAndrew Ippolito: Or here. Here's a better one, that the true power of science is in its predictive nature.\nAndrew Ippolito: If it's not predictive it's not science.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. For example, you discover a new species. Andrew Ippolito: You go, you're hiking along. And somewhere in the Southeast Asia. I did come across this extinct volcano that has a cave in it and walk inside of it, and you're in this like kind of weird Jurassic Park area.\nAndrew Ippolito: It's been uncontaminated for millions of years right and and you see this little furry creature lumber and Georgia and it looks kind of like a mouse, but it's like on like a mouse, you've ever seen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but this is a real thing. This happens it's rare but it happens we come across this on known creature and we look at it. We say, Oh, that's a mammal.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you immediately if you know your stuff you're rattling off and you must have four chambers heart. It's in the thermal it's got for it gives birth to live young. It has by an ocular vision or it's got stereoscopy or\nAndrew Ippolito: If it's a predator. It'll have its you know eyes up front. If it's a pre species, it'll have its eyes on its side. There's all sorts of little things that you you know that like the word mammal comes along with\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, I just saw this thing I've never seen him before. Right. Let's see you come across a dead one\nAndrew Ippolito: So that you can do it, you know, so that we don't feel bad killing it to do experiments on we we find a deadline and we will open it up, we do an autopsy. We look it's anatomy and\nAndrew Ippolito: Sure enough, it's got a fortunate heart and it's got the liver and it's got the kid. It's got all the stuff we predicted it would have that's that idea.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that's one example of how we do prediction. Andrew Ippolito: Another would be when when you know NASA engineers can launch a rocket ship and shoot a probe and land on a moon on like Titan.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is orbiting Jupiter. I'm sorry. Saturn. Andrew Ippolito: Right, you just think about it. Earth's doing this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we're doing this, actually we're spinning and we're moving through space. Andrew Ippolito: Saturn's doing the same thing Saturn's got a moon going around that while it's doing all that we're all moving in these crazy undulations are these these orbits and we throw something off our planet and we hit that planet bullseye.\nAndrew Ippolito: That we are able to predict the trajectories based on what we know about science. And so we can land things on all sorts of places that are exotic\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, intelligent design. Andrew Ippolito: Let's talk about that for a second intelligent design.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a pseudo science. We can repeat it ID. Andrew Ippolito: Intelligent Design was postulated by a group of non denominational religious leaders and lawyers trying to challenge the law in New Jersey, years ago, to be able to teach creationism in the classroom, side by side with evolution theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. And this was after they were told they're not allowed to teach creation in a science classroom next evolution theory. So like, All right, well, how about\nAndrew Ippolito: How about we just get remove God from the equation and they came up with this thing called intelligent design the intelligent creator\nAndrew Ippolito: There's this idea of the watchmaker analogy, where you're walking down the beach and you come across a watch, and the sand, you pick it up and you admire. It's complexities and the gears and all the engineering and you can't help but think about the person who made it\nAndrew Ippolito: Somebody didn't just happen by chance the ocean didn't just, you know, Hawk up perfectly made watch\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, that's the idea of intelligent design what comes out of intelligent design there. Nothing there are no predictions here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Intelligent Design does not predict anything if intelligent design is real, then there's nothing. There's you can't come up with a testable hypothesis here.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's why it's not so that's one of the reasons it's not science. The other reason is not sciences, you can't falsify it, you can always hand wave and explain why, whatever. And it's not\nAndrew Ippolito: That that's enough. You can't falsify it and you doesn't make predictions. You can't test it to be true or not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Maybe it's true. I'm not. So I'm not saying intelligent design is false. I can't say that either. I can say it's not scientific. And that's all I can say.\nAndrew Ippolito: This goes into the idea of pseudoscience. That's something else false science pseudoscience sounds like science people use the mystics and data and they sound confident in what they're saying and there's books on this stuff. And sometimes I have the word doctrine for their names."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 2): Science And Assumptions","link":"https://youtu.be/YsNccORLBZk?si=5_SodyNWAkUiVdW4","chunkTitle":"Testing Hypotheses","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of testing hypotheses through experiments and the nature of scientific proof.","start":"44:39","end":"51:24","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This goes into the idea of pseudoscience. That's something else false science pseudoscience sounds like science people use the mystics and data and they sound confident in what they're saying and there's books on this stuff. And sometimes I have the word doctrine for their names.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. My favorite was reading a book called The force of evolution by Dr. So and so, and he was an astronomer. That's why he had a doctorate, and he was writing a book on why evolution wasn't true.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not really sure what astronomy has to do with that. But yeah, the doctrine front of his name.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the first chapter talks about him sitting in his library, smoking a pipe. Oh, he must be smart and I must trust him because he's in a library, smoking a pipe. It's kind of amazing how how this works. It takes advantage of the human brain, you know,\nAndrew Ippolito: How we think about things. So anyway, that that's the hypothesis. Right. Andrew Ippolito: So even meets these criteria. It's a scientific hypothesis. Once you make this statement.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can then use it to. It's a launch. Think of the hypothesis as a base of operations or base camp. This is where we're going to launch our adventure.\nAndrew Ippolito: We're going to go off, we can go off into all these different directions. Okay, that hypothesis can make all of these different predictions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, sometimes there's a fundamental one in there right these predictions are the if then statements that we were just talking about with Tori.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that so so let's just go here, the sky is blue, right, you look up the sky is blue. Okay. And you're like, Oh, wow. I wonder why is the sky blue. There was a question.\nAndrew Ippolito: The sky is blue, because it reflects the ocean. There's the steam.\nAndrew Ippolito: If the sky is blue, because it reflects the water Andrew Ippolito: Then. And so somebody felt it in for me. Have fun. If the sky is blue, because it reflects the ocean, then make a prediction.\ntori bloemker: Only half of the sky would be blue. Andrew Ippolito: Oh,\ntori bloemker: That's an interesting one. Andrew Ippolito: And why is that because of it because you're like on land and\nDo here. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Okay, so, so can we can we test that. I mean, okay. Oh no, we can test it. We can look. No, the skies are blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's a load of hokey, can everybody has come up with a Andrew Ippolito: testable prediction here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Another one. Andrew Ippolito: If the sky is blue, because it reflects the ocean. Then if\nAngela Harbeck: Know, then you can bring in like the concept of sunsets and stuff and say them. What is the sky turn like pink and purple then\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, right. You could. That's good. So like Andrew Ippolito: If this guy was good because it reflected the Andrew Ippolito: Ocean, then why doesn't this guy change color the ocean, not changing color. I don't see a pink ocean or sometimes you do. I guess it's reflecting off, but then who's first to the who is the pink. The pink up from\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. My problem with that is, I just can't think of how to test that doesn't give me anything I can work with. I like it though.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that doesn't give me the ability to do an experiment, which is what we're gonna do next year, but I like it. Anybody else or maybe you can take that idea and come up with a test for it. I can't, I'm not smart enough to like on the fly here to develop something like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: But how about this, let's think about location. Andrew Ippolito: How about this one. If the sky is blue, because it reflects the ocean, then if we go into the middle of the continent.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like Nevada or, you know, Ohio. Now they got the Great Lakes out there. Let's go somewhere like Arizona.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if, if the sky is blue, because it reflects the ocean, then if I go to Arizona discussion. I'll be blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: How's that Andrew Ippolito: Road Trip. Andrew Ippolito: So we go to Arizona.\nAndrew Ippolito: We look up and the sky is gray haha check me\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Did we just prove it to be true. Andrew Ippolito: Or we just, no, no. Why not, why not, why not Jordan. You're shaking your head.\nAndrew Ippolito: What's going on there.\nJordan Russell: putting me on the fly here. Jordan Russell: Probably wouldn't be true because you know you're automatically assuming that you know because this guy is grey, you're automatically correct that, you know,\nJordan Russell: That the ocean that the skies and reflecting the ocean. But did you take account to like whether, you know, it's just overcast, is that the reason why it's great. You got asked questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: You got it exactly right. Right. So let's say you go to your scientific meeting and you're like, I just showed that this guy is not blue because our first word because it's gray out in Arizona.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the audience member, raise your hand and say, well, that day. I mean, you're telling me you saw that January 27 2017 it was raining that day there was a storm going through the area.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yeah. Right. Exactly. All right. Well, fine. All right. Well, so I'll go back to Arizona more road trip and now finding an excuse to travel and so you spend\nAndrew Ippolito: A month, looking at the sky. And of course, you know, I think most places in Arizona. I'm sure that one of those days within the month is going to be blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so, so what did we just, what did we just do we just destroy the idea that the sky is blue, because it reflects the ocean. Right. There's no ocean out there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Did I prove anything. Andrew Ippolito: No. And that's the secret to this science is not in the business of proving\nAndrew Ippolito: All science can do is disproof Andrew Ippolito: And what's ever left standing. That's the most accurate thing, but that thing itself can be replaced by something else. Someday science is replaced by better science.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're not in the business of proving things. Well, you can prove that true that now. Now, you get it. That is not an argument you camp. Well, you can't prove us wrong either right like that's not what that's not what science does science doesn't prove\nAndrew Ippolito: I just destroyed your idea come up with something better."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 2): Science And Assumptions","link":"https://youtu.be/YsNccORLBZk?si=5_SodyNWAkUiVdW4","chunkTitle":"Stereotypes and Reasoning","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the role of stereotypes in inductive reasoning and the importance of recognizing and overcoming them.","start":"51:24","end":"55:41","content":"Andrew Ippolito: I just destroyed your idea come up with something better.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or I just destroy my own idea. I have to come up with something better.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this this if then statement. Okay, so you come up with this, you come up with a tentative statement that explains the thing. And from there, you come up with this if then logic that's deductive reasoning.\nAndrew Ippolito: Deductive reasoning is when you start with a generality, and you've come up with a hypothetical specific already. So one way you can think of all this reasoning is we start with some single observation that gives rise\nAndrew Ippolito: To this generality. Andrew Ippolito: And then from that generality, we can come up with another idea. And the cool thing is, is we can come up with a whole bunch of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Each one of these points represents a different prediction.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And that's, that's the, that's the rationalism and science.\nAndrew Ippolito: I made this observation I came up with this generality. This generality leads to all sorts of these individual predictions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is the inductive reasoning and this is the deductive reasoning.\nAngela Harbeck: Have a question. Andrew Ippolito: Yeah, go ahead. Angela. Angela Harbeck: So the inductive reasoning. That's like more for hypothesis and then the deductive is for like prediction.\nAndrew Ippolito: You got it. That is exactly right. Angela Harbeck: Good.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so. So here's a slide on that. Andrew Ippolito: So this idea of inductive reasoning specific ideas or specific you can say observations.\nAndrew Ippolito: general concepts. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, we've all heard we all deal with stereotypes. Okay, a stereotype, the concept itself is a mental shortcut.\nAndrew Ippolito: We evolved to survive. Right. Our job is to not die. That's you could think of it that your everyday life. You're just you're every moment to moment is just a moment of not die. That's, that's life. It's just not\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and one of the reasons that we don't die. We're making decisions every moment of every day that lead us to not die.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. And so one of the things that we do is when we're in situations that are sudden like you're driving your car and somebody you know\nAndrew Ippolito: cuts you off, and you have to slam on the brakes right think that situations like that where we're given partial information and we have to make a decision. And it's a life or death situation or maybe it's an inconvenience. Let's, let's not go to extremes necessarily\nAndrew Ippolito: What our brain does in these moments is very quickly builds a hypothesis and comes to a conclusion and then makes an action out of it. We have to do it to survive. Sometimes\nAndrew Ippolito: And our brains are really good at at why they evolved to the point where I mean we're still around, right, our brains we inherited from our ancestors and ancestors and assets are the answers and and they all survived. So we're really good at this survival thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: A stereotype. Andrew Ippolito: Is based on partial information. And that's exactly what inductive reasoning is\nAndrew Ippolito: Stereotypes are not hard coded into our brains. Our brains are capable of making stereotypes, but we all start with a clean slate.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so all the stereotypes, though we all hold our from our direct experiences or education or the culture that we surround ourselves with or the shows we watch whatever we come up with all these stereotypes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the reason why our brains are wired that way is for survival. But as humans we be we have the power of recognizing it for what it is, which is why we can overcome our stereotypes.\nAndrew Ippolito: That make sense. Andrew Ippolito: That's part of being human. That's part of being scientifically literate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Really just being educated is being aware of that stereotypes are there and being able to know that and being able to say, hey, that's just my brain, looking at that stereotype. Let's look at this and or more realistic way.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's inductive reasoning. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: This is how we use our brain to develop hypothesis deductive reasoning is we take these general take take the stereotype make a prediction and then test it."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 2): Science And Assumptions","link":"https://youtu.be/YsNccORLBZk?si=5_SodyNWAkUiVdW4","chunkTitle":"Examples of Reasoning","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito provides examples of deductive and inductive reasoning and their application in scientific contexts.","start":"55:41","end":"59:30","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So that's inductive reasoning.

One of the fun ones I came up with. You're sitting Andrew Ippolito: What will we do systematics will do this to actually know what I'll say that story for a woman do taxonomy, nevermind.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the, the idea here is, is it, it gives us a pool to work with these these various predictions, give us the ability to take them and go and test them.\nAndrew Ippolito: We do that by developing experiments. We'll talk about that later. So here's, here's the ideas of these reasonings are some real examples are so Dr. I mean, I'm definitely right here. That's a specific observation. Okay, I'm a biology professor\nAndrew Ippolito: So these are the premises. This is the major premise. This is a minor premise. And here's the inference all biology professors are definitely right here.\nSilly Andrew Ippolito: Actually Dr Gospel is kind of definitely right here I should I should lift in this guy. He's just kind of death all around.\nAndrew Ippolito: Including his left here though right here. Andrew Ippolito: I wonder, right. So you're like that read your brain to be curious about it. I wonder if all biology professors are somehow right definitely right here. That would be really bizarre.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but that's that's rationalism right there that and of course that's ridiculous.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's the conclusion that you draw. So, so, of course, what do you do, you have to go and test it. That's where the empiricism comes in.\nAndrew Ippolito: In this case, all we have to do is send a bunch of emails to a bunch of biology professors and ask them a question if they're definitely right here and they write back and see why you harassing me\nAndrew Ippolito: This is such a strange question. Andrew Ippolito: Just yes or no. It's a simple question, Dr.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. All right. All people are mortal. Dr. Eyes, a person\nAndrew Ippolito: Is mortal Andrew Ippolito: Right, we're going from a general concept here.\nAndrew Ippolito: To a specific Andrew Ippolito: Rican test that to just trying to kill me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have at it.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys get the idea. Andrew Ippolito: Hi, I'm on this side of the screen. You can't try to kill me.\nI was just about to make an Alexa Alexa, because after I\nAndrew Ippolito: write tests testable prediction. Andrew Ippolito: So, Tori. Do you see the difference now between the hypothesis and the prediction.\nAnd how they're actually different things. tori bloemker: Yeah, and I like I got confused like I do Quisling a lot and I wrote down like my definitions, um,\ntori bloemker: And I think I mixed one of them which like really confused me as in like the hypothesis and the inductive reasoning. I think I switched the inductive and deductive\nAndrew Ippolito: That like Andrew Ippolito: That's fine. tori bloemker: I did that. Andrew Ippolito: For so many years.\nAndrew Ippolito: It takes a long time for your brain to finally settle on this.

Trust me, I\nAndrew Ippolito: Get it, it's this is something that you guys are going to price do over for the next 10 years of your life until you finally get it that or or you're like what I did.

Others are going to rerun your experiments, they're gonna they're going to rip you to shreds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. And imagine you drew a picture or you wrote a poem or you practice a musical song you did something that you're proud of and you presented to a group of 50 people who also do that thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And all of them are criticizing you, That was terrible. That last note you hit was wrong and that was discord and blah, blah, blah, or that that his head's too big and they're just ripping like oh hey guys this terrible like stuff. I can't handle it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, that's what science is it's ripping into shreds. So the strongest experiments, the most rigorous, the ones that are performed in the most precise careful ways are the only ones that make the cut.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the only ones that your enemies, except because that's the thing about science is your enemies accepted. In fact, that's how peer review works.\nAndrew Ippolito: You publish something you're you do all these experiments you write it on a piece of a manuscript and you submit it to an editor to some journal\nAndrew Ippolito: That's how it works, that that editor gets your manuscript. Andrew Ippolito: And they have a board of editors. They have like 200 people that are, you know, senior scientists who have been in the field for years in various places. And so this editors job the senior editors job is to chunk that to a group of like five people.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those are your enemies. Those your rivals your competitors your competitors. Review your work and they pick it apart and they send their report back to the editor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the thing is, is then this is how it works. If your enemies, like, all right, that's true, that's true, that's a good that's that's a good yeah yeah I would have done that too. Oh, that's a good control. That's really convincing. Okay, I can't do this thing is ironclad, you know, publish it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. And there's five of them. Let's say there's three to five, you know, this one says it's garbage. This one says it's garbage. But these three. See, it's gold.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the senior editors job now is to take all that into account and then send something back to the guy who wants to publish it and say to them, either here. Here's a bunch of experiments, you have to do again before these guys accepted or they say we're going to publish\nAndrew Ippolito: Write your enemies accepted your work now gets published that's peer review.

What if the temperature of the cage also impacted this\nAndrew Ippolito: What if mouth mice got even more obese is slightly cooler temperatures like 20 degrees Celsius, instead of let's say 15 degrees Celsius, instead of 25 degrees Celsius.\nAndrew Ippolito: How could we do that, how can we take this experiment and also ask the question for for temperature\nJordan Russell: You would probably have to put the cages in separate rooms with different temperatures and probably monitor than using a baby monitor or something so you can keep\nAndrew Ippolito: Like Andrew Ippolito: Sorry. Look, he's he's poopy Jordan Russell: Yeah. Andrew Ippolito: So here's the thing, we would have to take all 10 of these cages, right, we would have to replicate it, we would need 20 cages now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. And you would put half in the cold and half of them warm and maybe 30 cages, you'd have to put 10 of them in a normal temperature that is like the controlled temperature\nAndrew Ippolito: Another 10 would have to run in the cold and another 10 would have to run on the heat.

Andrew Ippolito: They say that you can you can you can prove anything with statistics, they say.\nAndrew Ippolito: The key really is what you might call a data visualization database that's a whole field, you can get your PhD in data visualization\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea of conveying information through visual media is arguably more important than any other method of communicating science in this day and age.\nAndrew Ippolito: Especially because we're all glued to screens and we look at things for two or three seconds, it is so important to present your information in a way that makes sense. That could be read very easily. So I'll teach you some of that stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: First thing is the simplest way to present data where there's a single, single simple relationship between the variables like we just described, where you have a single dependent independent variable.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's a relationship between those variables. We're going to show that relationship visually.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the way we generally do it as well plot it on the axes that you learned about your math classes. Alright, so the independent variable, the one that you control or the one is outside of the system anyway is always on the x axis and the one that varies depending on it is on the Y axis.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So here I'm going to go to my black screen here. We got\nAndrew Ippolito: There's basic kinds of relationships between things Andrew Ippolito: Okay, I'm just gonna do this.\nActually Let's just do three Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's say that we have, we have our independent variable and our dependent variable. Doesn't matter what they are. What we're looking at here, these visual relationships between them.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So let's let's go here. Let's lift. A, B and C.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's look at a for a second. So we see that within a as our independent variable increases in value.\nAndrew Ippolito: The dependent variable decreases. Andrew Ippolito: See that as one goes up the other goes down. So what's the, what's the name of this one. What do we call this kind of relationship.\nAndrew Ippolito: You might have, if you took some more advanced math classes, you might have that in there. Do you\nAndrew Ippolito: Say that again, sorry. tori bloemker: I was gonna say we are you talking about like constant increasing, decreasing\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no.

For example, you've all probably looked at some kind of weird random mosaic or you looked at like a pattern of wood green and you're like, Hey, that looks kind of like a face. We've all seen faces and things\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Raise your hand if you've experienced that at one point, your life or not. Andrew Ippolito: Yeah, exactly. We've all you see faces and things.

And we all start feeding off of each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's how science works. It's, it's communal it's it's socialism, you have to share everything you have to put it all out there.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I'm doing a, let's say that I'm doing experiments on a particular kind of cancer and I publish, you know, something on it. Others will ask me, they'll send me an email and say, hey, I need some of those cells I have to give it to them now.\nAndrew Ippolito: I need some of that region in me to kill the cells. I haven't going to have to share that with you. Now that's academic research. I'm not talking about. I'm not talking about the pharmaceutical world I'm talking about academic research.\nAndrew Ippolito: It's an open book. Andrew Ippolito: Doesn't mean it's convenient. I had to wait two years for a woman in France to send me a piece of paper with six little piece of DNA on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: They made the DNA and they take a pen, they put on a piece of paper just normal piece of filter paper and they dry it they put it in the mail. They mail it to you and you take it, you cut it out. You put it on to rehydrate. It's kind of cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: Took a freakin years to send it to me. I couldn't do any of my work without that stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: She wasn't bound by law to send it to me. But she's a busy woman.\nAndrew Ippolito: I still remember the day I got that in the mail. You know, I had to international stamps everywhere from France, I guys talk\nAndrew Ippolito: In the interest of time, I'm going to gloss over this, this, this is just a way of looking at an experiment. So here we go. Here's a real experiment that happened.\nAndrew Ippolito: And probably should. I didn't put this together. But in retrospect, they should use different colors, instead of different shades of green that are kind of hard to distinguish\nAndrew Ippolito: But you have your growing plants. Over the course of 14 days you're looking at the little germination is happening.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you're measuring the rate of growth and not the right you're measuring the height of the stem in millimeters over time. And you can see that if you so there's the controls you that control. That's just plain old water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. And you can see here's the control. So the plant grew over 14 days to a height of about what like 230 millimeters\nAndrew Ippolito: If you supplement the water with sugar. Andrew Ippolito: You can see it doesn't grow as high.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you supplement it with tea. You can see it grows even worse. And if you put some salt in there. And you can see it hardly gross.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So let's say that your tea company and you're trying to find a new market and you wanna, you want to sell your tea as as a supplement for people watering your plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Herbal tea makes your plants better Andrew Ippolito: And so the CEO, the company TELLS US scientists, go do an experiment, show me that the tea makes plants grow better. What's the problem with that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sure. Show me to make some better. Go ahead. tori bloemker: Just have no proof because the data that they collect disprove that like idea.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes. So, more importantly, I just told you to go and prove something that we don't know is true or not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Go show me that T makes plants better Andrew Ippolito: As opposed to show me the effect it has on plant growth.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see the difference. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's say that I was the research scientist and I came to the CEO and I showed him this he'd be like your fire. Get out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Bob. Get in here, make this data show me what I want it to with Bob going to do, let's get rid of the song.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh no, let's keep the song. Let's get really control.

Alright, so I'm going to skip through the rest of this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's, here's how I end my scientific method lecture. Here's the analogy. Let's say that you have this. We've all gotten to play with these at one point or another, maybe you get a god, you take the hammer and you can crack it open and look at the gems inside. Read the crystals.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we have this universal God in the dead center of that God is the true universal truth, whatever it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we have to try to get to it. And so what do we do, we start off with this god Andrew Ippolito: You know we smash it with our bare hands. No crack it open as well. And we keep hitting it and hitting it and hitting until it's at a point where we can't use our hands to break it anymore. And so what do we do, we take a hammer. We start cracking with a hammer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sledgehammer jackhammer we get really, really aggressive with it, we get a smaller, smaller until no matter how much we hit it with the hammer. It's just ricocheting off.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so then we get out our got a jackhammer then we start blowing it up, we get some teen t\nAndrew Ippolito: We just keep blowing it up again and again and again we get this little nugget. And then we go out into the Nevada desert we stick it out there and we just nuke it\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we spend a year, finding it after whatever fell, and we do that again. And we finally get this little grain of truth, we think, right, then what do we do from there.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean, I guess the only thing you could do. After that, like, throw it into the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then it's gone forever. You know, we can't go into the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we have to just stop. Andrew Ippolito: And say that we're never going to see that beautiful little shiny glowing thing inside. We're never going to get there. We're just human.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we have to go back a step, we have to accept that this is as close to the truth is we're gonna get"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 0 (Part 2): Science And Assumptions","link":"https://youtu.be/YsNccORLBZk?si=5_SodyNWAkUiVdW4","chunkTitle":"Why is the Sky Blue?","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the scientific explanation behind the blue color of the sky.","start":"2:07:08","end":"2:08:52","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And so we have to go back a step, we have to accept that this is as close to the truth is we're gonna get\nAndrew Ippolito: But we can never know for sure because we're limited Andrew Ippolito: In this ties back to my perspective concepts, the methods of acquiring knowledge. And so hopefully I made a compelling case here.\nThat science. Andrew Ippolito: Now, why is the sky blue\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody here ever learned this before will learn about the electromagnetic spectrum later when we do photosynthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea here is that the different colors you perceive are driven by the different frequencies of photons and the wavelength of a photon correlates to how much you can bend\nAndrew Ippolito: In but when it changes its environments, you go into a prism right but it also\nAndrew Ippolito: Is what determines whether or not it gets absorbed by molecules or ricochets off of them. It goes right through them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it turns out Andrew Ippolito: That. So here the sun's up here and here's earth and there's our atmosphere, the different colors of light coming from the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reds and yellows and greens there because of their wavelengths and because of the molecules are atmosphere. They just make it right through.\nAndrew Ippolito: The Blues because of their wavelength. They're the highest and energy they spend some time ricocheting up there until they basically they take their sweet time and eventually make the way to your eye.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's why when you look up the sky's blue\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I'm gonna you can watch this on your own.

Well, I think maybe that's the textbooks version of it. Any case. That's my son jack back when he was like five, we went to the aquarium over in Camden\nAndrew Ippolito: And we went to the hippo cage, the hippo hippo exhibit and it was like high noon, and the sun was coming down, just in this perfect way of casting us light. And so I got this great shot.\nAndrew Ippolito: This really this captures that that childhood curiosity that you have to find again when you become a scientist. So here's one one amazing video\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what you're seeing here, this, this is not a clip from the new avatar movie.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is not Pandora.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think there's in California somewhere.\nAnd\nAndrew Ippolito: When the waves crashing nine. You can see this amazing phosphor essence.\nAndrew Ippolito: Bio fluorescence.\nAndrew Ippolito: There.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here's microorganisms in there that only upon getting slammed by the oceans.\nAndrew Ippolito: By crashing ashore just pay a stress response so that we don't know for sure exactly why they glow. We think it's a stress response. It's a way of blinding predators and then running away.\nAndrew Ippolito: But\nAndrew Ippolito: But right it's magical. It's just, it's amazing. This is what captures our imaginations and makes us want to study what's going on in the world. It turns out the things that caused this are these, these guys here called\nAndrew Ippolito: Dial flagellate here they are. These are scanning electron micro graph. So, these little critters. Their, their own protest phylum\nAndrew Ippolito: Their, their own branch of life. There's nobody else like these things they have a test, which is there's outer coating this outer shell and they always have to flagella.\nAndrew Ippolito: One's going along horizontally and one's going along vertically and that causes them to swim in these very dizzying patterns.\nAndrew Ippolito: They're also the cause of things like the red tide.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you ever heard about that we have these horrible spreads of this stuff that just blights and kills everything along the ocean short in some places, these guys also cause that. So there are mixed bag.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's another one of my favorite quotes nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you take all of the facts, we've learned about biology and you remove evolution from the equation, it becomes a loose collection of seemingly unrelated nonsense.\nAndrew Ippolito: That biology as a science only makes sense in light of evolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a picture of the ocean floor. Some of the darkest regions. This is just next to what are called black smokers and white smokers. These are the deep sea thermal events, which is where we believe life began\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, three and a half billion years ago, and these these little habitats, a super isolated habitats weren't even discovered until the 1970s late 70s.\nAndrew Ippolito: They were postulated to exist, based on thermal anomalies. There's your observation.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we lacked the technology to go down and look until the late 70s, and we created this little robot named Alvin me through over the side of the boat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Had a tether on them for electricity and we drove them down there and we turned on the lights and started recording\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we discovered blew our minds, we didn't think we were going to discover much of anything down there may be some microbes. Instead, we found the entire ecosystems of exotic animals.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see these shrimp.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are these these enormous shrimp. If you look carefully, I don't know if you can see it really well here, like maybe this guy here.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have these crazy big googly eye things. It turns out, those are highly evolved thermo sensors that let them since very small fluctuations in temperature.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why, because they live in a little slice of survival land if they get too close to the deep sea thermal event they die because it's boiling\nAndrew Ippolito: And if they go too far in the other direction they freeze because it's almost it's pretty much zero degrees. And so they can only live in this little sliver of temperate area and they have to be able to sense that\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, there's crabs, a groom each other. We found that they farm off of each other. These little bacteria, we observe them eating off of each other, kind of like the way he picked through each other's hair.\nAndrew Ippolito: These, these crabs do that.\nAll sorts of cool stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what we're gonna do this semester is we're gonna learn biology through the lens of science, we're going to apply everything we just learned about the last day and a half.\nAndrew Ippolito: To the study of this this phenomenon that is you could think of life as an emergent property of chemistry, physics and math."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 1) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/AIioFxfO1Go?si=hWg8N5_KqK7RhoS-","chunkTitle":"Unity and Diversity of Life","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the unity and diversity of life.

It's the study of the unity of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the diversity of life. What we mean by that when we see unity of life that everything that we come across all the empirical knowledge. We've derived from our observations and our tests show us\nAndrew Ippolito: That so factually that everything has\nAndrew Ippolito: A core\nAndrew Ippolito: List of traits that are the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: For example, everything's made of cells, everything's got DNA all the coatings, the same\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we're going to do this semester is we're really we're going to focus almost exclusively on this facet. And that's really that's what bio one is you're taking the course what bio 121 by one principles of biology, one that's the unity of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: By 122\nAndrew Ippolito: The diversity of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that all of these things that have all these unifying characteristics are also incredibly diverse\nAndrew Ippolito: There are so many wonderful variations on these themes\nAndrew Ippolito: And so evolution theory is our best model to explain these two observations that life on Earth appears to be unified, it has a unified set of characteristics and that life on Earth is incredibly diverse\nAndrew Ippolito: Why why why because evolution by natural selection.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's the thing. The Tree of Life as we call it.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we go out in the world that observant empirically looks like this. Lots of branches.\nAndrew Ippolito: It could have looked like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just like one branch, maybe two. In other words, the world could have been filled with nothing but like humans and dogs.\nWhich is way better than humans and cats.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it's not. We have all sorts of things other than cats.\nLike starfish. What's up with them.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have a water vascular system. They have a hydraulic pump system that's how they stick to everything. And they're made out of this stuff that melts and then freezes again star Fisher crazy things. They are so alien\nAndrew Ippolito: And despite that, so they're called the kind of terms.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are other relatives or things like the sea cucumber.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is not a vegetable, but an animal.\nRight.\nAndrew Ippolito: Despite the fact that it kind of alien to us. They are our sister clean in the animal kingdom. In other words, whereas close to kind of germs as any other we're more close to the kind of germs than any of the other animals. The one thing we have in common with starfish. We have endo skeletons.\nAndrew Ippolito: We've got bones. They got plates.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's the unity of life and then diversity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now when we say life. There's no single definition to life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Least scientists can agree on what we can do is we can take all of our empirical data all our empirical findings we can look at it all and we can come up with a laundry list of common traits and that's what this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: We're going to go through these one at a time. I'm just rattle them off. Right now we have. So I call these drivers from an older book I used the hallmarks of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first hallmark of life is life is ordered\nAndrew Ippolito: There's an order to the chaos.\nAndrew Ippolito: The second is, is that life is able to reproduce life begets life.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in fact, that's the only way we can get life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Modern Life in its current form.\nAndrew Ippolito: The life. We do have grows\nAndrew Ippolito: So cells get bigger. If they're unicellular or they'll divide\nAndrew Ippolito: Their multicellular they'll develop if they're multicellular we develop bacteria don't really so you throw those two things to get their growth and development.\nAndrew Ippolito: Life processes energy\nAndrew Ippolito: We'll talk about what that means.\nLater.\nAndrew Ippolito: Life maintains itself through regulation.\nAndrew Ippolito: You sweat when you're hot is shiver. When you're cold eat when you're hungry you maintain yourself you regulate your internal environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: You respond to it, too.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, you're in an area that's dangerous you run away.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or if you're out in the cold you run to the warmth, you'll respond to the changes in the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: starts raining, you run inside your seat cover.\nAndrew Ippolito: life evolves.\nAndrew Ippolito: It changes slowly over time to keep up with the changing environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can call that adaptation\nAndrew Ippolito: And then lastly, this the most basic unit of life is the cell. And that really cellular it kind of ties back into order, right. So we're going to go through all of this now.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first one order here that's left over. I have to delete that. Forget the line there.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talked about water. Remember our perspective lecture, we started with the courts and electrons and we make Adams, the atoms makeup macro molecules. When we say macro molecule. I kind of skipped. You can put molecule in here if you really want you\nAndrew Ippolito: There is a difference a molecule is just a system of atoms that are made out of different elements. We'll talk about that in the next chapter, a macro molecule is\nAndrew Ippolito: Generally\nAndrew Ippolito: A polymer of some kind of meaning there's repeating units to it. Not always, but generally it's like DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or proteins or poly saccharine will learn about all that, too. And then later chapters.\nAndrew Ippolito: You put a list together and you can make up the pieces of cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell, or the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or the nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's all sorts of stuff will learn about this semester. The Goji apparatus and the lice isms and paroxysms\nAndrew Ippolito: The psycho skeleton.\nAndrew Ippolito: Century was all sorts of fun stuff. And we put all that together and we get a cell. And that's why that lines there, that's the smallest unit.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's the, that's the smallest system that we can look at and identify as having the property life.\nAndrew Ippolito: With cell theory is all about is the smallest unit of life is the cell. There's nothing smaller than a cell that we consider life only cells meet the criteria that we just said before."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 1) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/AIioFxfO1Go?si=hWg8N5_KqK7RhoS-","chunkTitle":"Reductionism vs Systems Biology","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the approaches of reductionism and systems biology in studying life.

Now we're talking about multicellular charity, things like animals fungus and plants. A couple properties they make up systems of cells that are specialized\nAndrew Ippolito: That's the key difference. That's one of the key differences between unicellular life and multicellular life is that unicellular life is made out of sales at all pretty much do the same thing that all generalists.\nAndrew Ippolito: They're all entrepreneurs all wear all the hats.\nAndrew Ippolito: Multicellular organisms like you and me. We have cells that have specialized to do different jobs.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so when we have the systems of cells, we can call that a tissue.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you have mucosal and you have neural tissue you have Aussies tissue right we have all sorts of different kinds of tissues.

You can see that there are systems of them like the cardiovascular system.\nAndrew Ippolito: The lymphatic system.\nAndrew Ippolito: The nervous system. And when you put all the systems together and they are working in synergy with each other. You can now call that the organism.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like you or me. And if you want you can even you could draw another line there.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's generally where we keep ourselves. We're organisms.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's not where the story of life ends when you take the collection of organisms of the same species like our little zoom class here we can call that a population.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's your first formal definition here a population is a group of organisms.\nOf the same species.\nAndrew Ippolito: To species. Oh god, don't even ask that question yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's not even easily answered.\nThere's different definitions of species.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's just say we agree that all humans are the same species. And we're a group of them. So we're a population that's what the word means population got a bunch of dogs are bunch of cats.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are bunch of cows. You say that population of cattle that population of elm trees that population of bacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: When there's different species involved in the mix. When you have a collection of individual organisms of divergent species or a different species. Now we're talking about a community.\nAndrew Ippolito: You talk about the forest community.\nAndrew Ippolito: You talk about the community organisms that live in your house.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, we just have a population. We don't have any pets. It's just me. Oh, trust me, there's lots of things, living in your house. Besides, you\nNow I'm creeped out.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's a bunch of spiders in the walls and millipedes and yeah there's a bunch of arthropods in there, sorry to break it to you, and there's all sorts of proteins and microbes that you can't see. You know what most of us beneficial or neutral Ts. Don't worry about it.\nAlexa DePrisco: Yeah, go ahead. So could you say, then a collection of populations would be a community.\nAndrew Ippolito: What I say that, what's the community.\nAlexa DePrisco: Could you say like a collection of populations and would create a community.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yeah, you could say you take two populations and\nAndrew Ippolito: smash them together, you get a community. So you can see a communities, a system of populations that is totally satisfied and then the neat thing there is, you know, usually you think of a population of things like\nAndrew Ippolito: We're going to talk about systems, a lot this semester. And so this is a really important concept to get in your head. Again, you have a system it's again it's a collection of matter with a boundary\nAndrew Ippolito: So you can think of a population as a group of organisms have the same species. Right. And you can, therefore, think of a community as a collection of organisms have different species.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you could you could say there's a community. And then, even though we don't have a boundary between all the dogs and all the people or whatever. You could still consider that system is containing a population so that population doesn't. They don't have to be in the corner.\nRight.\nAndrew Ippolito: You'll also see an analogy. Sure. When you do chemistry between molecules and compounds. Right, so like the analogy there is a molecule would be like a population like\nAndrew Ippolito: molecular hydrogen is just hydrogen molecular oxygen, they think of like H2 or, oh, to our end to those are molecules, right, those aren't compounds, the compound has multiple elements. Those are populations of atoms. So you can think of something like water than like a community.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, there's that you can kind of tie an analogy there maybe\nAndrew Ippolito: Make so community is multiple species. OK. So again, though it's a collection of organisms.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now here's the part that I want you to really grow with. I want you to really take this next insight in and chew on it for a while. We're going to take the environment into account. Now the mountains in the wind and the sand in the forest and all the things\nAndrew Ippolito: We can't have life without life without the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: They, they, they meet each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't just have life existing in the vacuum of space, you need some kind of scaffolding, maybe some kind of platform upon which life can exist.\nAndrew Ippolito: We usually refer to this as an ecosystem.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so when I say ecosystem. It's a pop. It's a group of organisms.\nAndrew Ippolito: In consideration of their environment together. And so ecosystems are a unit of life. And so your environment as part of life. We can't separate the two.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is where the philosophies of environmental ism come in.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that we have to take care of our environment. In the same way that you take care of your room at home.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Maybe you don't make your bed, maybe your beds all messy. Maybe you haven't changed your sheets in a while.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or maybe you freshly launder your sheets every weekend. Make your bed every day.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe you're a good steward of your environment or not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe you never clean and never vacuum and you got mold and fungus growing everywhere, and you get sick.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's the idea.\nAndrew Ippolito: Except, leave your room. I know that's hard to do these days.\nAndrew Ippolito: And go outside and now think about your yard and think about your community and think about the region. Think about, think about right, we have to take care of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's no I had this physics teacher in high school, Mr mcguckin he had all these little fun expressions and one of them was, there's no such place as a way\nAndrew Ippolito: I'm just gonna throw this away.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like it's gotta go somewhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: You're just going to move it as far away from you as possible so you can ignore it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. What do you do every day you go to store, you buy something, you bring it home. Eat it has got out of plastic and mesh and cardboard and what do you do today.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, I'm going to clean it all nice and I'm going to put on the recycling bin and what's it doing from there it goes to the curve and then it's out of sight, out of mind.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, turns out we're not recycling anything anymore. China's not accepting recyclables we're burning it all.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or we're storing it somewhere. So in one day. We can recycle it. The point is, is that\nAndrew Ippolito: We're gonna unnecessarily mess up another place. This goes down to the second law of thermodynamics, we'll talk about later in the semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: There's always going to be an increase of chaos when there's order.\nYou can't escape it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's the ecosystem. And from there you have what's called the biosphere. There's one. It's called Earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Didn't come with an instruction manual we're messing it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: I should say we're making it less suitable for humanity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Again, the earth is going to be just fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: We're not\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: That's it, that's the order to life. So you can, in a way, say the earth is alive, an organism that's all the way down here organisms have, you know, everything below it, but not above it.\nAndrew Ippolito: That said, you could see your community, you have a microbiome, you've got stuff going all over your body.\nAndrew Ippolito: Dozens and dozens of species of different things all helping you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Very few hindering you you have bacteria that live on your skin that prevent bad bacteria from taken over.\nThere, helping you out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yeah, bacteria in your gut that make vitamins you need\nFrom your food that you couldn't make yourself, you'd be sick without him.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your community.\nAndrew Ippolito: From their perspective, you're an ecosystem.\nAndrew Ippolito: Each level of that order gives rise to completely new characteristics that make no sense at the level below it.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call these kinds of properties emergent properties.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now your book your chapter one does a good job explaining the key differences between reductionism and systems biology and these are important concept. You have to know these, you'll see, I imagine, they'll be quizzes and tests. Questions on this kind of these concepts.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 1) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/AIioFxfO1Go?si=hWg8N5_KqK7RhoS-","chunkTitle":"Emergent Properties","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains emergent properties at different levels of life. He provides examples of emergent properties, such as bonding at the atomic level, metabolism at the cellular level, muscle contraction at the tissue level, and cognition at the organism level. He also discusses adaptation and prediction as emergent properties of populations and communities. He concludes by highlighting the importance of ecosystems and the biosphere in understanding life.","start":"23:38","end":"28:37","content":"Andrew Ippolito: These are approaches that humans take to studying science reductionism is the approach where you start with the fundamental building block.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you study it in the hopes of getting insight into how it works into the system. For example, studying the molecular structure of a certain kind of protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or studying a particular kind of tissue that's the reductionist approach.\nAndrew Ippolito: Systems Biology, you can think of as the holistic approach just starting at the top and looking at the relationships between all the moving parts.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is no right or wrong way. Don't think one of these is better than the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: It's all about the questions you're asking\nAndrew Ippolito: The questions that make you curious inform the way you do your science.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's just a simple list of examples of emergent properties for each of the given levels of life's orders starting at the bottom here. Now we got atoms. And so you would say that to Adams coming together. You can think of chemical bonding.\nAndrew Ippolito: So bonding is an emergent property of atomic systems.\nAndrew Ippolito: A single atom right so this is how you think about it, if you like, what is that an emergent property or not if it makes sense. It's not. If it doesn't make sense. It's an emergent property here. Let me see it for the example take just a single atom of hydrogen, just by itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: It can't bond with itself, talking about it bonding makes no sense. You have to have another atom there so bonding becomes a characteristic that systems of atoms have\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look at the cell, the cell has a metabolism.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, what's metabolism will learn about that in a second is basically the sum total of all the chemical reactions in a cell. You could also say it's the sum total of reactions and an organism. Right. So a single molecule, it makes no sense to talk about the metabolism.\nAndrew Ippolito: That a water molecule has\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. But, but it just it's nonsensical.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, muscle contraction. Can you imagine talking about muscle contraction when talking when referring to a single molecule of water or a single cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, no, it's a tissue thing vision, being able to to take all of these wavelengths of light and fuse them together and get a cohesive picture and make sense of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: That requires not just your eyes, but your brain that requires an entire visual system that's crazy complicated a single I can't see a single cell within your I can't see vision as a emergent property of the system, the visual system.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, your immune system. Think of an organ system. Think of your, your lymphatic system and your blood right so the plot the level of organ system you have immunity. The concept of immunity.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Cognition, I think, therefore I am.\nAndrew Ippolito: You the organism can cognitive\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't adapt to the environment, slowly over millions of years but populations of humans can so adaptation to the environment as an emergent property of populations papi. So this is how you would say it populations evolve.\nAndrew Ippolito: Organisms do not\nAndrew Ippolito: Organisms respond to the environment populations adapt over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here's one that's that'll probably make a lot of intuitive sense to your prediction.\nAndrew Ippolito: This only makes sense in the context of a community. Think of the classic example of up and up in Canada and the boreal forests, you have\nAndrew Ippolito: White. Snow bunnies and FOX FOX is on the bunnies foxes eat the bunnies. The bunny populations go down the fox population goes down.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the bunny popular when the fast population goes down the bundle population goes up the fast population goes up and they've studied this. You can see the ups and downs of these two different\nAndrew Ippolito: Populations. Yeah, go ahead. Alexa. I didn't realize\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, we're over time. Oh, you guys. I warned you about this. I'm over time by 10 minutes. All right. I'll finish this slide will be done.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, yeah. Please, please feel free to interrupt me like Dr. It's one o'clock class over terrible at this. Especially the beginning of the semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the last one carbon cycling, we have we have these elemental cycles and we'll pick up will pick up exactly there on Wednesday we'll go from there. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so I'm going to actually know what I mentioned that I invoke this idea. So this slide here emergent properties will be on the quiz on Wednesday. Okay, but nothing after this. Okay.

Andrew Ippolito: And what it can do right, this is something that might seem obvious, at first, but this is a guiding principle in all investigations in biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a critical when when you look at the way engineers design whatever they're designing whether it's a bridge or better hammer form follows function that's the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when scientists are you know studying something new, like the corona buyers we look at you know the spike proteins on its surface, let me see the way they're shaped that tells us that gives us a hint as to what they are meant to do."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Life as an Emergent Property of Cellular Organization","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the cell as the fundamental unit of life and explains how life is an emergent property of cellular organization.

Andrew Ippolito: At that moment and Tom showing you both of those embryos have all the same cells.\nAlexis Micewski: Stand I think exactly yeah. April Neeld: it's the it's the genes what the gene say, did you think.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of the Jesus the the APP. Andrew Ippolito: there's an APP running I got the human APP we got the mouse APP you can switch them.\nright here it's kind of like a hard coded to APP. Andrew Ippolito: cool our energy processing.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that. Andrew Ippolito: We need to take in energy to do the work of life and we'll talk more about this when we get.\nAndrew Ippolito: Later into the Semester, but for now let's just do some simple definitions here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't really define energy until you define work. Andrew Ippolito: what's work let's take matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then let's change this position. Andrew Ippolito: that's that's the simplest definition of work, take something.\nAndrew Ippolito: and change its position it's a push it's a Pole it's a twist it's a break it's a build it's it's just any movement at all.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the cell is constantly doing work it's building things it's breaking things it's moving things it's changing things right there's there's chemical work different chemical reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a. Andrew Ippolito: Movement think about your cell bringing things in or pushing things out so there's physical movement of things.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's mechanical work, they can muscle contraction okay so there's all sorts of different ways this are so So what is energy, energy is the capacity to do work.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's the potential to do work. Andrew Ippolito: It doesn't mean you're doing the work.\nAndrew Ippolito: means you can do the work. Andrew Ippolito: And that's why you can divide energy really into two groupings, so you have potential energy and kinetic energy and we've all learned this when we were kids right potential energy is energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what i'm talking about, you have the potential to do the work kinetic energy is when you're actually doing the work.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we can talk about force here, but then we start getting too much into physics, we talked about force of force is you can think of it as a focused concentration of kinetic energy, such that you're applying an acceleration to an object.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and in order to move something right so here take this pen take the stylus right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I apply some and I give it some energy right, how do you give it energy I apply a force to it, the force is when I go from a T equals zero is not moving and now we start moving it i've accelerated it right so forces.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are things are a force leads to an acceleration.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and in order to apply it, for us, you need energy, so we don't usually call it. Andrew Ippolito: The electromagnetic energy we call it the electromagnetic force because it can accelerate things okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's there's subtle differences between the concepts of energy and force you don't have to know that for this class, but when you start thinking about and tying in and you meant, you have to take physics, you have to tie all this together at some point.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, so we just did what kind of worked as a cell mechanical chemical movement right trans trans So you can see, transport, mechanical and chemical if you want to you know doable but, again, we cover all this later in the Semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right now, the question here now, is it all we need all you need is love, all you need is energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's not true, you need things to right, so you could say the hallmark of life would be life requires energy materials."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Homeostasis and Regulation","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the concept of homeostasis and its role in regulating life.

Andrew Ippolito: Remember that bad joke.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's no so that's the material, what do we have to do we have to put energy into it, to build that house right, you have to put the energy and that's that's what we're doing so, so if you just got this pile of goo that's not a cell that's not life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we have to put the work in. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so that's energy processing.\nAndrew Ippolito: So distinguished now the whole the energy in the materials energy flows through systems.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like the force flows through us if you ever watched Star Wars and you listen to obi wan kenobi talking to Luke about the force the force flows through.\nAndrew Ippolito: energy flows through it doesn't cycle. Andrew Ippolito: right on our planet here you got the sun you got the earth Okay, the energy goes to the earth and then back again.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's flowing in it's a one way flow. Andrew Ippolito: And yes, and I believe that leads to the heat death of the universe, but that's not happening anytime soon you have to worry about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in the meantime we got life here it's fun it's like a vacation that last couple billion years, then she is going to end but we won't be here to see it.\nAndrew Ippolito: In contrast to that the nutrients do cycle okay everything on earth carbon nitrogen the Austrian the phosphorus the water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon dioxide, whatever the nutrients cycle and all of them have their own cycle there's a carbon cycle of the phosphorus cycle, the nitrogen cycle you'll learn about all that stuff and bio to when you do ecology.\nAndrew Ippolito: For now, just understand it's all connected the ecosystems on earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: As they evolved. Andrew Ippolito: As long as they don't get mocked up are sustainable and perpetuate through time until there is a disturbance whether it's a huge forest fire or a meteor impacting.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our farmer starts building a ranch down the road.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Life regulates.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, I mean think about it, if a cell just hung out and didn't do any work the universe, is going to collapse in on it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Things are going to flow into the cell, as it does its metabolism we sold chameleon inside the cell that's gonna die.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's the cell to do right well so here think about your home think about where you are right now and think about the fact that if you didn't spend a little bit of time whether every day or every week or every month cleaning your room.\nAndrew Ippolito: doing your laundry folding it and putting it away vacuuming dusting.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right organizing your books, or whatever you have in hanging out in your room it's going to start slowly falling apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the universe, is just always trying to crush down around us that the universe tends towards chaos.\nAndrew Ippolito: And life is all about fighting that and we have to put energy into it.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: And so we have this concept called homeostasis homie homie or homo homos that same.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then status means still. Andrew Ippolito: you're keeping yourself the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so at this moment in time i'm alive my cells are alive, this is what we want to keep we want to stay like this that's what homeostasis is work is all about.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the concept of homeostasis right, so you can think of, we have all these various parameters, we have sugar levels in our blood, we have a temperature, we have ceiling concentrations, we have magnesium and calcium and iodine all these things.\nAndrew Ippolito: and any one of those things, has to be within some realm of normalcy that's why you can see, this little green boundary point you know it's it's, not a single line I didn't draw it like this it's not a lie.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if it was a line you would say things like this i'm uncomfortable it's not 74.2 degrees.\nAndrew Ippolito: I need to be 74.2 degrees I don't like 74.3 degrees now i'm cold or now i'm hot right you're like i'm okay with between 70 and 73 degrees or 68 and 72 or you're like, whatever your favorite range of temperatures it's a ring right.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're okay with it fluctuating a bit that's what that is that's a it's a fuzziness there's a fuzziness here right your blood pH, for example, it ranges anywhere from 7.35 to 7.45.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is kind of tight, but if you think about that that's a logarithmic scale that's still that's a that's a healthy difference going too far in one direction or the other, though right, so if we start heading away from that sweet spot there's your stress, we talked about from day one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what do you do when you get stressed you respond to it, you try to bring it back to the green."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Evolutionary Adaptation and Homology","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the concept of evolutionary adaptation and its role in shaping life.

Andrew Ippolito: So here's one of my fun little things here you got the goldilocks idea right this porridge is too hot this part is too cold and there's porridge is perfectly balanced Santos you guys don't know who fantasies you have no idea fantasy, some of it yeah So if you ever watched the.\nAndrew Ippolito: The avengers. Jordan Russell: Of course, and everything it says. Andrew Ippolito: yeah not everybody does.\nAndrew Ippolito: raise your hand you don't know who fantasies. Andrew Ippolito: yeah there's a couple of you, so you know you know the the marvel movies, you know iron man and all the ones that you missed.\nAndrew Ippolito: All that all that nonsense, so the big bad guy in the avengers was this guy named fan oh so what he wanted to do was he wanted to murder instantly half of all life in the universe.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because we were unsustainable and that was a solution to it just randomly kill half of everything in the universe, with a snap.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he did it. Andrew Ippolito: And then the whole next movie was about them, trying to fix that it was kind of dramatic at the end of the movie where he actually does the snap and you see people feeding to dust.\nAndrew Ippolito: spider man like I don't feel so good, and then he disappears like half of all the people that you like watching on the screen just turn to sender ash.\nAndrew Ippolito: was kind of disturbing honestly and then the next movie starts and you're like I don't like where this is going at all it's made me feel uncomfortable I hope this ends well.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe you should just not watch it. Andrew Ippolito: But. Andrew Ippolito: here's the idea. Andrew Ippolito: Go ahead Jordan.\nJordan Russell: Ah. Andrew Ippolito: I heard you say something I thought. Jordan Russell: Oh no but I cried during that movie.\nJordan Russell: I will, I will gladly admit I was sobbing in the theater during a game.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah you definitely get attached to these characters. Alexis Micewski: Would you say Alexis i'm with them there ironically i'm watching all the marvel movies in chronological order again so.\nAlexis Micewski: Nice. Andrew Ippolito: Nice yeah yeah i'll go back and watch. Andrew Ippolito: My once my kids get older they'll probably be interested in them definite it for him at seven years old.\nJordan Russell: I am currently like head over heels for one division, right now, so I need that to come out like all at once.\nI can't I. Andrew Ippolito: I watched the first to have that. Andrew Ippolito: Actually, and I was really amused by it it's so different and I.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can talk about that later. that's I have some theories. Andrew Ippolito: Anyway, and then, of course, demand delorean but you know what is this biology class this isn't talk about your favorite TV show class i'm sorry I Maybe I should I have to remove this slide it's just a distraction at this point.\nAndrew Ippolito: But you get the idea right there's a sweet spot there's a balance that LIFE has to achieve, and the way it does this is through our metabolism right so here's a fun thing the word homeostasis means states Dell, the word metal the Greek root for this.\nAndrew Ippolito: literally means. Andrew Ippolito: A change.\nAndrew Ippolito: To change so you're. Andrew Ippolito: Changing to stand still.\nAndrew Ippolito: hmm, and so the idea here so First let me formally defined this when I say your metabolism that's the sum total of all the chemistry that's happening in your body or all the chemistry is happening in a single cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: It depends on what you're talking about your best metabolism it's the big web of chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and you can roughly divided metabolism into two subdivisions there's the building reactions and the breaking reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: and call them the nationalism and the capitalism you refer to things like this catabolic reactions anabolic reactions Okay, and the way to remember this is well just think about what cats do.\nAndrew Ippolito: They what do they do, they destroy. Andrew Ippolito: right they break things they shred rapes, they eat your ferns they eat lasagna.\nJulia Lakchin: To be fair, dogs do the same thing, though.\nJordan Russell: Have you ever own dusky. Julia Lakchin: No, but my boy. Andrew Ippolito: i'm not being fair okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: My. Julia Lakchin: My shoes, but this dog eats my shoes all the time. Andrew Ippolito: that's terrible okay we're gonna remind this.\nJordan Russell: yeah my husky has eaten drywall. Andrew Ippolito: There we go. Andrew Ippolito: Just flat out named it's called dog.\ncapitalism. Andrew Ippolito: or. Jordan Russell: How about cannibalism for canine.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea you're never gonna forget this now metabolism is a breaking reactions, I say remember it cats break so to do catabolic reactions and then imagine there's this.\nAndrew Ippolito: cute little girl five year old sitting on the carpet building with Lincoln logs and her name is Anna and he's building this little cast a lot of Lincoln logs.\nAndrew Ippolito: into the cat comes along destroys it. Andrew Ippolito: there's an apple ISM.\nAngela Harbeck: Please, so do they play off of each other. Yes. Andrew Ippolito: that's actually Angela.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a great insight that it's kind of neat how you just amelie did that there's this concept so here here's the here's the cartoony version of this, so we have this this molecule that we break down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's your breaking reaction. Andrew Ippolito: catabolic reaction, right now, these reactions give off energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we'll learn how this works in more detail later this master Okay, and then here's a different system okay and we're gonna go oh hold on actually let me.\nlet's do like this. Andrew Ippolito: But yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna go up and build it there's your Annapolis oops a na.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're gonna need energy for that, so this is called coupling.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we eat our food we break our food down, we take the energy out of that and we put it to work building our stuff that we actually need.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, yes it's all connected and this. Andrew Ippolito: Is your metabolism.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excellent okay so life regulates itself through its metabolism so here's the analogy, at the end of the day, you're running on a treadmill.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's life. Life is a treadmill. Andrew Ippolito: you're running to stay in place you stop running What do you do you fall off that stuff.\nAlexa Deprisco: The world doesn't stop it's relentless. Andrew Ippolito: It just keeps moving forward and it's up for you to keep up with it.\nAndrew Ippolito: What does that sound like the beginning of the movie trainspotting now. You got to keep up.\nAlexa Deprisco: All right. Andrew Ippolito: So, like what is. Alexa Deprisco: Then the.\nAlexa Deprisco: The metabolism, like in terms of the cat cannibalism like breaking down then.\nAndrew Ippolito: So khattab realism we're going to learn that would be. Andrew Ippolito: Things like like causes that would be when we take our food.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our food particles and we ingest them and then insides are inside our.\nAndrew Ippolito: ourselves, we go through chemical reactions, I take those big molecules and make them into little pieces, so we take a protein and we break it down into amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are we take a poly soccer I like starch and we break it down into glucose molecules and we take those glucose molecules are breaking down to carbon dioxide and water Okay, and as we're breaking everything down.\nAndrew Ippolito: There shedding energy. Andrew Ippolito: And then we're taking the energy or building things were taking amino acids and we're putting together into poly peptides and make proteins we're putting glucose molecules together to make glycogen we're building phosphor limits for our cell membranes etc, etc.\nAlexa Deprisco: So, like could you liken it to them like breaking down nutrients so processes perfect. Andrew Ippolito: yeah breakdown nutrients to build the cells needed materials.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good good good good all right. Andrew Ippolito: So one of the ways we regulate ourselves as we respond to our environment and you can think of reactions to extrinsic factors like if I say fire, we all run away I can't yell that in class because that's kind of dangerous.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right bomb that would get me arrested. Andrew Ippolito: Right, but you get the idea right you're there's something happening in the environment and you're gonna respond to it, and if you don't.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well then, you can't regulate anyone because you're dead, you have to respond your environment life response okay there's also intrinsic factors which I left out, I guess yeah there are intrinsic factors to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay things like you know eat something bad let's just leave it at that you react to that to those intrinsic and extrinsic factors but there's in the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then this last thing here, this is probably the most important trade. Andrew Ippolito: evolutionary adaptation life evolves.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: This is something that happens slowly over time, one of the fun little ways to think about this and think of think of your arm to cut your arm off at the top of the shoulder and just imagine all these bones here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, take those bones and considered them and imagine them being made out of some kind of semi movable clay and being able to sculpt and stretch them.\nAndrew Ippolito: But keeping them in place keeping the bones that are connected to bones, in the same locations relative to each other, but being able to change their shapes adapting their shapes to their environments, this is exactly what we see.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we look at all mammals, for example. Andrew Ippolito: If you look at a salamanders arm or leg or crocodile or a bird.\nAndrew Ippolito: or a bad, so I don't wanna say mammals tetrapods and it quadruples anything with four limbs, where you have that Axial skeleton and the APP indicator skeleton.\nAndrew Ippolito: My favorite one to think about. Andrew Ippolito: Is the whale.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because we think of Wales, as these aquatic organisms which they are and they swim gracefully through the ocean, and they have those flippers just like fish that flippers are fins.\nAndrew Ippolito: The thing is, though, is that whales got some in there. Andrew Ippolito: are useless thumb granted you can't ever go to a to a whale and be hey and he used.\nAndrew Ippolito: To making fun of me I can't do that there's no opposable thumb it's hidden in there you wouldn't even know what was in there, unless you did an autopsy.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they've had their carpools they have their Meta carpools they have their phalanges all those are there and the whale flipper whereas if you look at a fish fin the fish finish just something it looks like a fern leaf there's no complexity there.\nAndrew Ippolito: was also have hip bones. Andrew Ippolito: Why would a whale have a hip bone it doesn't have legs.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: The only rational explanation is sometime long ago wells weren't always in the ocean.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look at how well swims right here, everybody do this for me take your hand and mimic the way a fish swims How does a fish swim like this right Okay, and how does the whale swim.\nAndrew Ippolito: totally different if I tied your body up if I tied your legs up and I three in a pool.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whatever way that's mean and you had a swim How would you swim just like a whale right, I think the mermaids think of the little mermaid How does she swim same thing right her legs are tied together that's how basically well swim and dolphins and other marine mammals right.\nAndrew Ippolito: This concept, where there's at some point in the distant past a common ancestor so you could say that there's a common.\nAndrew Ippolito: anatomical structure between our arm and that way elfin we call that relationship homology.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talked about homologous. Things So you can see homologous structures.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are homologous jeans. Okay we'll talk about those later in the semester we do genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we talked about homologous chromosomes.

Taylor Campbell: About birds, though, like birds don't scream.\nTaylor Campbell: Like you know they're like tweet tweet tweet so like two big dinosaur. Andrew Ippolito: Right right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now one thing we have, so I know, like the the. Taylor Campbell: duck old dinosaurs plesiosaurs.\nAndrew Ippolito: We we doing the simulations well i'll take the bones and they'll run simulation where the way air goes to them how they breathe and there'll be able to emulate probably.\nAndrew Ippolito: The way they sounded you know they like lead instruments like if somebody showed you a clarinet, but it was dead you forced air through it, you can probably simulate how it's supposed to sound so yeah we don't know exactly how they sounded like but based on their.\nAndrew Ippolito: Their their skeletal structures we can take good guesses at it, but yeah we will never know for sure, until we find something.\nTaylor Campbell: With soft tissue and see what else was there, but like aren't they supposed to be related somehow like to hell bird sound yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sure, I mean if there are common ancestor but the outstanding question, there would just be you know bird song, the idea of bird song is that something that is unique to birds, just like, if you look over at the BATs right.\nTaylor Campbell: Only BATs flying and you sound similar. Taylor Campbell: kind of have that like that, but squeak enos.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah. Andrew Ippolito: So it's. Andrew Ippolito: very likely that dinosaurs sounded like modern birds a bit, but maybe.\nTaylor Campbell: Like deeper voices we doing. Taylor Campbell: Okay.\nAll right.

Elizabeth Doebler: that the earth is 5000 years old.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's not true it's not it just makes sense it's so the Christian Bible has an entire book in it the big gets and there was this Irish priest many, many centuries ago, who did some math and calculated that it went from Adam to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Joseph so, and so we got that we got that we got that we got that and we got Joseph and then he had his 13 kids and they're all the tribes of canaan the canaanites and.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you do the math there and the average person live 200 years old well blah blah blah it 200 years old, what well that's in the Bible the older the older books of the Bible they believe that they measured years, not in solar years but in lunar years.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's pretty cool and so that's why you have people living to two or 300 years old, those are those are months really are 200 months old it's still it's do the math is still about 80 years old, so he was still an old guy it just not 200 old.\nAndrew Ippolito: The point is, is that they do that that's where the 5000 comes from there was this Irish priest there's a documentary about flat Earth is really yes, I began watching that and actually the first two or three minutes of it, I was like this watching it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like they're putting this on TV, I mean this is they're trying to actually build the case for flat earth this guy's actually trying to build the keys 40 standing in front of a lake saying look a flat, it is i'm like.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah what is. Elizabeth Doebler: an experiment gets completely like blown up at the end and it's like i'm you're wrong and then they're just like oh wow.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah so at the end of that the way. Andrew Ippolito: They come up with this idea, like so in order to prove that the earth is flat, we are going to buy this $25,000 laser interferometer thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're if the end we're gonna take measurements every 20 you know every hour for 24 hours, and if the divergence in the degree, is more than 15 degrees, the Earth is is round not flat.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if there is no divergence the Earth is flat so we're going to go into the experiment do the experiment it's 15 degrees it's exactly as predicted rounder like so they're doing the interview and he's like yeah so so that's a problem.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we're gonna keep at it and, like it just I, for I didn't. Elizabeth Doebler: bother with it no you're wrong the Earth is not flat.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah The thing is, is that guy made a lot of money and his. Andrew Ippolito: Followers he. Andrew Ippolito: He was making a lot of money he.\nAndrew Ippolito: actually put a cruise together for the flat earth crazy we're going to look at the end of the world up in the Arctic and that year, I remember telling my students if anybody goes, please take some pictures, for me, I really want to do with the end of the earth looks like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so here's how it works this there's nothing magical about this, you have an individual group of organisms of the same species you got population within that population there's variations.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Future Possibilities","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito speculates on the future of human lifespan and the potential for extending life through advancements in medicine and technology.

Andrew Ippolito: And what it can do right, this is something that might seem obvious, at first, but this is a guiding principle in all investigations in biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a critical when when you look at the way engineers design whatever they're designing whether it's a bridge or better hammer form follows function that's the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when scientists are you know studying something new, like the corona buyers we look at you know the spike proteins on its surface, let me see the way they're shaped that tells us that gives us a hint as to what they are meant to do.\nOkay. alright. Andrew Ippolito: So the next level appears the cell itself, we see life emerging you see light so here here's one thing you could say life is an emergent property of cellular organization or the at the level of the cell life is an emergent property being alive, is a characteristic.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this is where we start our story and biology it's not where we ended, but this is a good place to or maybe this is a fulcrum point the Center of it all this is the beginning.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of the story of life. Andrew Ippolito: And we're going to talk all about cells this semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the things I can tell you right away, is that there's only two kinds of cells on the planet.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's prokaryotes and carriers there's nothing there's no third.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can think of these as super domains there's super domain pro carrier and super domain you carry on and from within their all of the stuff we're going to talk about this semester off and next semester, when you take bio to.\nAndrew Ippolito: will be will be within that there's a huge range of sizes between cells, the largest size, for example in the human body is the the female over the egg.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the smallest cells ever recorded of these very primitive bacterial cells, like all the way down to Point one microns.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Naming and Classifying Organisms","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the difference between binomial nomenclature and classification in biology.","start":"2:30","end":"10:15","content":"Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so once we get to that cell here, we could say that that cell will reproduce cells, we get cells beget cells right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the question, there is, you know where that first cell come from and evolution doesn't give us that.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's that's a theory called a bio genesis. Andrew Ippolito: The idea that life arose from organic material that was not itself alive.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's your your Ian Miller experiment, the primordial soup, the idea of.\nAndrew Ippolito: pants panspermia the idea that early earth was pummeled by.\nAndrew Ippolito: meteors that brought Richard Yannick molecules to the surface, that then. Andrew Ippolito: played in the soup and eventually gave rise to self replicating molecules which, in turn, got encapsulated which gave us the first produce cells, which give us the first cells, and here we are lost, like the definition, you would give for that ap bio genesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can say this is a theory the theory. Andrew Ippolito: That life arose.\nAndrew Ippolito: From. Andrew Ippolito: There, so I don't know what the scientific term for dead is let's just say from dead organic.\nmolecules. Andrew Ippolito: that's the easiest that's just one way to put it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so that there was a spontaneous generation that happened back then it wasn't instant it wasn't approved, but actually based on, but we could put together the forensics of it, it took a billion years between a cool down earth and the first cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it took another billion years before those probiotic cells around what gave rise to eukaryotic.\nAndrew Ippolito: Could you like, once we got yeah good. Taylor Campbell: So could you kind of relate that to like a phoenix.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah I like. Taylor Campbell: The phoenix. Taylor Campbell: dies, and like catches on fire, but then once it cools like it kind of like a little tiny cells nine gets old again, thank you.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah. Andrew Ippolito: The earth is like a phoenix. Andrew Ippolito: And we're still in its first life cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's cool thanks for that i'm going to. Taylor Campbell: keep that in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the idea of growth, now is the idea there's two ways, you could take a growth getting bigger or replicating into marcel's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so all of us started as a single microscopic cell year there was an ova they got fertilized by sperm and that single zygote went into two to four to eight to 16 all the way up to what you are now, which is about 30 to 40 trillion cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And every moment of every day, every second of every day, your body's producing 100,000 new cells.\nWhich is kind of a crazy number, if you think about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: hundred thousand cells are dying. there's something called apoptosis which will learn about later.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then, when we talk about development, this is kind of distinct to multicellular organisms, the idea that that one cell specializes in you know and.\nAndrew Ippolito: It gives rise to multiple cells and then some of those cells become one thing, and some of those cells become another thing, so the idea of development.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason, when we throw this together in one hallmark of life is because we have to really capture that idea of what happens once you've got that sell.\nAndrew Ippolito: That cell begets another cell that cell becomes bigger that cell divides rate and it depends on you know you got bacteria that are unicellular and you got us that are multi site or, and so this captures all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the question is, and what decides what so I can show you a live image of an embryo under a microscope and two embryos, they look exactly the same, and I tell you that one of them is a human embryo, Mr there was a mouse embryo.\nAndrew Ippolito: What decides which is which you tell me what do you think.\nAngela Harbeck: isn't it like the cells that you have, because if you don't have certain cells for that body like to create that, then you can't like make up that like living being.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, but here's the thing. Andrew Ippolito: At that moment and Tom showing you both of those embryos have all the same cells.\nAlexis Micewski: Stand I think exactly yeah. April Neeld: it's the it's the genes what the gene say, did you think.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of the Jesus the the APP. Andrew Ippolito: there's an APP running I got the human APP we got the mouse APP you can switch them.\nright here it's kind of like a hard coded to APP. Andrew Ippolito: cool our energy processing.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that. Andrew Ippolito: We need to take in energy to do the work of life and we'll talk more about this when we get.\nAndrew Ippolito: Later into the Semester, but for now let's just do some simple definitions here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't really define energy until you define work. Andrew Ippolito: what's work let's take matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then let's change this position. Andrew Ippolito: that's that's the simplest definition of work, take something.\nAndrew Ippolito: and change its position it's a push it's a Pole it's a twist it's a break it's a build it's it's just any movement at all.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the cell is constantly doing work it's building things it's breaking things it's moving things it's changing things right there's there's chemical work different chemical reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a. Andrew Ippolito: Movement think about your cell bringing things in or pushing things out so there's physical movement of things.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's mechanical work, they can muscle contraction okay so there's all sorts of different ways this are so So what is energy, energy is the capacity to do work.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's the potential to do work. Andrew Ippolito: It doesn't mean you're doing the work.\nAndrew Ippolito: means you can do the work. Andrew Ippolito: And that's why you can divide energy really into two groupings, so you have potential energy and kinetic energy and we've all learned this when we were kids right potential energy is energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what i'm talking about, you have the potential to do the work kinetic energy is when you're actually doing the work.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we can talk about force here, but then we start getting too much into physics, we talked about force of force is you can think of it as a focused concentration of kinetic energy, such that you're applying an acceleration to an object.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and in order to move something right so here take this pen take the stylus right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I apply some and I give it some energy right, how do you give it energy I apply a force to it, the force is when I go from a T equals zero is not moving and now we start moving it i've accelerated it right so forces.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Taxonomy and Phylogenetics","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces taxonomy and phylogenetics as tools used in systematics to categorize and study organisms.","start":"10:15","end":"20:45","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Are things are a force leads to an acceleration.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and in order to apply it, for us, you need energy, so we don't usually call it. Andrew Ippolito: The electromagnetic energy we call it the electromagnetic force because it can accelerate things okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's there's subtle differences between the concepts of energy and force you don't have to know that for this class, but when you start thinking about and tying in and you meant, you have to take physics, you have to tie all this together at some point.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, so we just did what kind of worked as a cell mechanical chemical movement right trans trans So you can see, transport, mechanical and chemical if you want to you know doable but, again, we cover all this later in the Semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right now, the question here now, is it all we need all you need is love, all you need is energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's not true, you need things to right, so you could say the hallmark of life would be life requires energy materials.\nAndrew Ippolito: You need carbon right, you need nitrogen, you need oxygen you need water right, so you need all this stuff to build the cell not just energy you can't make anything out of energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I like to say, think think of a think of a hill somewhere that has a whole bunch of lumber and and boxes of nails and and ladders right and move we call this thing a house No, of course, not that's just I mean that's a pretty terrible house right.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's like calling the asteroid field, the planet. Andrew Ippolito: Remember that bad joke.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's no so that's the material, what do we have to do we have to put energy into it, to build that house right, you have to put the energy and that's that's what we're doing so, so if you just got this pile of goo that's not a cell that's not life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we have to put the work in. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so that's energy processing.\nAndrew Ippolito: So distinguished now the whole the energy in the materials energy flows through systems.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like the force flows through us if you ever watched Star Wars and you listen to obi wan kenobi talking to Luke about the force the force flows through.\nAndrew Ippolito: energy flows through it doesn't cycle. Andrew Ippolito: right on our planet here you got the sun you got the earth Okay, the energy goes to the earth and then back again.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's flowing in it's a one way flow. Andrew Ippolito: And yes, and I believe that leads to the heat death of the universe, but that's not happening anytime soon you have to worry about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in the meantime we got life here it's fun it's like a vacation that last couple billion years, then she is going to end but we won't be here to see it.\nAndrew Ippolito: In contrast to that the nutrients do cycle okay everything on earth carbon nitrogen the Austrian the phosphorus the water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon dioxide, whatever the nutrients cycle and all of them have their own cycle there's a carbon cycle of the phosphorus cycle, the nitrogen cycle you'll learn about all that stuff and bio to when you do ecology.\nAndrew Ippolito: For now, just understand it's all connected the ecosystems on earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: As they evolved. Andrew Ippolito: As long as they don't get mocked up are sustainable and perpetuate through time until there is a disturbance whether it's a huge forest fire or a meteor impacting.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our farmer starts building a ranch down the road.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Life regulates.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, I mean think about it, if a cell just hung out and didn't do any work the universe, is going to collapse in on it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Things are going to flow into the cell, as it does its metabolism we sold chameleon inside the cell that's gonna die.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's the cell to do right well so here think about your home think about where you are right now and think about the fact that if you didn't spend a little bit of time whether every day or every week or every month cleaning your room.\nAndrew Ippolito: doing your laundry folding it and putting it away vacuuming dusting.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right organizing your books, or whatever you have in hanging out in your room it's going to start slowly falling apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the universe, is just always trying to crush down around us that the universe tends towards chaos.\nAndrew Ippolito: And life is all about fighting that and we have to put energy into it.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: And so we have this concept called homeostasis homie homie or homo homos that same.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then status means still. Andrew Ippolito: you're keeping yourself the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so at this moment in time i'm alive my cells are alive, this is what we want to keep we want to stay like this that's what homeostasis is work is all about.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the concept of homeostasis right, so you can think of, we have all these various parameters, we have sugar levels in our blood, we have a temperature, we have ceiling concentrations, we have magnesium and calcium and iodine all these things.\nAndrew Ippolito: and any one of those things, has to be within some realm of normalcy that's why you can see, this little green boundary point you know it's it's, not a single line I didn't draw it like this it's not a lie.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if it was a line you would say things like this i'm uncomfortable it's not 74.2 degrees.\nAndrew Ippolito: I need to be 74.2 degrees I don't like 74.3 degrees now i'm cold or now i'm hot right you're like i'm okay with between 70 and 73 degrees or 68 and 72 or you're like, whatever your favorite range of temperatures it's a ring right.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're okay with it fluctuating a bit that's what that is that's a it's a fuzziness there's a fuzziness here right your blood pH, for example, it ranges anywhere from 7.35 to 7.45.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is kind of tight, but if you think about that that's a logarithmic scale that's still that's a that's a healthy difference going too far in one direction or the other, though right, so if we start heading away from that sweet spot there's your stress, we talked about from day one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what do you do when you get stressed you respond to it, you try to bring it back to the green.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you start getting hot if it starts getting too high, what do you do you sweat your body cools down again it pulls it back okay life has a tendency to settle in that middle part it's like a buffer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's the concept of homeostasis. Andrew Ippolito: So here's one of my fun little things here you got the goldilocks idea right this porridge is too hot this part is too cold and there's porridge is perfectly balanced Santos you guys don't know who fantasies you have no idea fantasy, some of it yeah So if you ever watched the.\nAndrew Ippolito: The avengers. Jordan Russell: Of course, and everything it says. Andrew Ippolito: yeah not everybody does.\nAndrew Ippolito: raise your hand you don't know who fantasies. Andrew Ippolito: yeah there's a couple of you, so you know you know the the marvel movies, you know iron man and all the ones that you missed.\nAndrew Ippolito: All that all that nonsense, so the big bad guy in the avengers was this guy named fan oh so what he wanted to do was he wanted to murder instantly half of all life in the universe.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because we were unsustainable and that was a solution to it just randomly kill half of everything in the universe, with a snap.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he did it. Andrew Ippolito: And then the whole next movie was about them, trying to fix that it was kind of dramatic at the end of the movie where he actually does the snap and you see people feeding to dust.\nAndrew Ippolito: spider man like I don't feel so good, and then he disappears like half of all the people that you like watching on the screen just turn to sender ash.\nAndrew Ippolito: was kind of disturbing honestly and then the next movie starts and you're like I don't like where this is going at all it's made me feel uncomfortable I hope this ends well.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe you should just not watch it. Andrew Ippolito: But. Andrew Ippolito: here's the idea. Andrew Ippolito: Go ahead Jordan.\nJordan Russell: Ah. Andrew Ippolito: I heard you say something I thought. Jordan Russell: Oh no but I cried during that movie.\nJordan Russell: I will, I will gladly admit I was sobbing in the theater during a game.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah you definitely get attached to these characters. Alexis Micewski: Would you say Alexis i'm with them there ironically i'm watching all the marvel movies in chronological order again so.\nAlexis Micewski: Nice. Andrew Ippolito: Nice yeah yeah i'll go back and watch. Andrew Ippolito: My once my kids get older they'll probably be interested in them definite it for him at seven years old.\nJordan Russell: I am currently like head over heels for one division, right now, so I need that to come out like all at once.\nI can't I. Andrew Ippolito: I watched the first to have that. Andrew Ippolito: Actually, and I was really amused by it it's so different and I.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can talk about that later. that's I have some theories. Andrew Ippolito: Anyway, and then, of course, demand delorean but you know what is this biology class this isn't talk about your favorite TV show class i'm sorry I Maybe I should I have to remove this slide it's just a distraction at this point.\nAndrew Ippolito: But you get the idea right there's a sweet spot there's a balance that LIFE has to achieve, and the way it does this is through our metabolism right so here's a fun thing the word homeostasis means states Dell, the word metal the Greek root for this.\nAndrew Ippolito: literally means. Andrew Ippolito: A change.\nAndrew Ippolito: To change so you're. Andrew Ippolito: Changing to stand still.\nAndrew Ippolito: hmm, and so the idea here so First let me formally defined this when I say your metabolism that's the sum total of all the chemistry that's happening in your body or all the chemistry is happening in a single cell.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Domains and Kingdoms","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the domain system and the hierarchy of classification from domains to species.","start":"20:45","end":"30:10","content":"Andrew Ippolito: It depends on what you're talking about your best metabolism it's the big web of chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and you can roughly divided metabolism into two subdivisions there's the building reactions and the breaking reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: and call them the nationalism and the capitalism you refer to things like this catabolic reactions anabolic reactions Okay, and the way to remember this is well just think about what cats do.\nAndrew Ippolito: They what do they do, they destroy. Andrew Ippolito: right they break things they shred rapes, they eat your ferns they eat lasagna.\nJulia Lakchin: To be fair, dogs do the same thing, though.\nJordan Russell: Have you ever own dusky. Julia Lakchin: No, but my boy. Andrew Ippolito: i'm not being fair okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: My. Julia Lakchin: My shoes, but this dog eats my shoes all the time. Andrew Ippolito: that's terrible okay we're gonna remind this.\nJordan Russell: yeah my husky has eaten drywall. Andrew Ippolito: There we go. Andrew Ippolito: Just flat out named it's called dog.\ncapitalism. Andrew Ippolito: or. Jordan Russell: How about cannibalism for canine.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea you're never gonna forget this now metabolism is a breaking reactions, I say remember it cats break so to do catabolic reactions and then imagine there's this.\nAndrew Ippolito: cute little girl five year old sitting on the carpet building with Lincoln logs and her name is Anna and he's building this little cast a lot of Lincoln logs.\nAndrew Ippolito: into the cat comes along destroys it. Andrew Ippolito: there's an apple ISM.\nAngela Harbeck: Please, so do they play off of each other. Yes. Andrew Ippolito: that's actually Angela.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a great insight that it's kind of neat how you just amelie did that there's this concept so here here's the here's the cartoony version of this, so we have this this molecule that we break down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's your breaking reaction. Andrew Ippolito: catabolic reaction, right now, these reactions give off energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we'll learn how this works in more detail later this master Okay, and then here's a different system okay and we're gonna go oh hold on actually let me.\nlet's do like this. Andrew Ippolito: But yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna go up and build it there's your Annapolis oops a na.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're gonna need energy for that, so this is called coupling.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we eat our food we break our food down, we take the energy out of that and we put it to work building our stuff that we actually need.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, yes it's all connected and this. Andrew Ippolito: Is your metabolism.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excellent okay so life regulates itself through its metabolism so here's the analogy, at the end of the day, you're running on a treadmill.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's life. Life is a treadmill. Andrew Ippolito: you're running to stay in place you stop running What do you do you fall off that stuff.\nAlexa Deprisco: The world doesn't stop it's relentless. Andrew Ippolito: It just keeps moving forward and it's up for you to keep up with it.\nAndrew Ippolito: What does that sound like the beginning of the movie trainspotting now. You got to keep up.\nAlexa Deprisco: All right. Andrew Ippolito: So, like what is. Alexa Deprisco: Then the.\nAlexa Deprisco: The metabolism, like in terms of the cat cannibalism like breaking down then.\nAndrew Ippolito: So khattab realism we're going to learn that would be. Andrew Ippolito: Things like like causes that would be when we take our food.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our food particles and we ingest them and then insides are inside our.\nAndrew Ippolito: ourselves, we go through chemical reactions, I take those big molecules and make them into little pieces, so we take a protein and we break it down into amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are we take a poly soccer I like starch and we break it down into glucose molecules and we take those glucose molecules are breaking down to carbon dioxide and water Okay, and as we're breaking everything down.\nAndrew Ippolito: There shedding energy. Andrew Ippolito: And then we're taking the energy or building things were taking amino acids and we're putting together into poly peptides and make proteins we're putting glucose molecules together to make glycogen we're building phosphor limits for our cell membranes etc, etc.\nAlexa Deprisco: So, like could you liken it to them like breaking down nutrients so processes perfect. Andrew Ippolito: yeah breakdown nutrients to build the cells needed materials.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good good good good all right. Andrew Ippolito: So one of the ways we regulate ourselves as we respond to our environment and you can think of reactions to extrinsic factors like if I say fire, we all run away I can't yell that in class because that's kind of dangerous.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right bomb that would get me arrested. Andrew Ippolito: Right, but you get the idea right you're there's something happening in the environment and you're gonna respond to it, and if you don't.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well then, you can't regulate anyone because you're dead, you have to respond your environment life response okay there's also intrinsic factors which I left out, I guess yeah there are intrinsic factors to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay things like you know eat something bad let's just leave it at that you react to that to those intrinsic and extrinsic factors but there's in the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then this last thing here, this is probably the most important trade. Andrew Ippolito: evolutionary adaptation life evolves.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: This is something that happens slowly over time, one of the fun little ways to think about this and think of think of your arm to cut your arm off at the top of the shoulder and just imagine all these bones here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, take those bones and considered them and imagine them being made out of some kind of semi movable clay and being able to sculpt and stretch them.\nAndrew Ippolito: But keeping them in place keeping the bones that are connected to bones, in the same locations relative to each other, but being able to change their shapes adapting their shapes to their environments, this is exactly what we see.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we look at all mammals, for example. Andrew Ippolito: If you look at a salamanders arm or leg or crocodile or a bird.\nAndrew Ippolito: or a bad, so I don't wanna say mammals tetrapods and it quadruples anything with four limbs, where you have that Axial skeleton and the APP indicator skeleton.\nAndrew Ippolito: My favorite one to think about. Andrew Ippolito: Is the whale.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because we think of Wales, as these aquatic organisms which they are and they swim gracefully through the ocean, and they have those flippers just like fish that flippers are fins.\nAndrew Ippolito: The thing is, though, is that whales got some in there. Andrew Ippolito: are useless thumb granted you can't ever go to a to a whale and be hey and he used.\nAndrew Ippolito: To making fun of me I can't do that there's no opposable thumb it's hidden in there you wouldn't even know what was in there, unless you did an autopsy.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they've had their carpools they have their Meta carpools they have their phalanges all those are there and the whale flipper whereas if you look at a fish fin the fish finish just something it looks like a fern leaf there's no complexity there.\nAndrew Ippolito: was also have hip bones. Andrew Ippolito: Why would a whale have a hip bone it doesn't have legs.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: The only rational explanation is sometime long ago wells weren't always in the ocean.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look at how well swims right here, everybody do this for me take your hand and mimic the way a fish swims How does a fish swim like this right Okay, and how does the whale swim.\nAndrew Ippolito: totally different if I tied your body up if I tied your legs up and I three in a pool.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whatever way that's mean and you had a swim How would you swim just like a whale right, I think the mermaids think of the little mermaid How does she swim same thing right her legs are tied together that's how basically well swim and dolphins and other marine mammals right.\nAndrew Ippolito: This concept, where there's at some point in the distant past a common ancestor so you could say that there's a common.\nAndrew Ippolito: anatomical structure between our arm and that way elfin we call that relationship homology.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talked about homologous. Things So you can see homologous structures.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are homologous jeans. Okay we'll talk about those later in the semester we do genetics.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Clades and Cladograms","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of clades and cladograms in systematics.","start":"30:10","end":"37:55","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right, we talked about homologous chromosomes. Andrew Ippolito: This word is an evolutionary word.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now there are some things out there, that are not evolutionary related, but instead evolved to do a job in a completely independent fashion right So if you compare something like an insect wing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the pterodactyl wing and a bird wing and a BAT wing all four of those wings let you fly, but none of those wings have common ancestry Okay, that is called analogy so there's homology and analogy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or you could say analogous structures.\nAre analogs. Oh boy that's just really meant that she here let's put a.\nAndrew Ippolito: analogs analogous structures structures that Okay, so if these are two different ancestors that were not uncommon and they converge on to a single function that's called convergent evolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and contrast. Andrew Ippolito: In contrast, you have a single common ancestor that branches out into two different things that's called divergent evolution divergent evolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: Looking at birds and BATs is a really, really good system, because it has both in their their skeletons are home logs.\nBut their wings are in analogs. Andrew Ippolito: and other words there's no common ancestor to the bird and the BAT that flu.\nAndrew Ippolito: birds devolved flight completely independently them BATs evolving flight, but they are both you would say quadruplets.\nAndrew Ippolito: They both have that APP and together skeleton in common, and so they have the same bones and they're appendages.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they have completely adaptive adaptive differently, and the way you can present that and what's number of cloud grams remember from that chapter 26 talk.\nAndrew Ippolito: We didn't really talk too much about this yet, but you read about him a clatter Graham is a visual representation of a hypothesis that connects things through evolutionary relationships.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a cloud Graham right there. Andrew Ippolito: A file a gigantic tree.\nAndrew Ippolito: is like a cloud it's essentially a cloud of ground but the the length of the lines tell you something about relative time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so cloud a grand think of as a generic concept that's like saying bar chart what kind of bar chart okay it's a classroom classroom is a generic thing it's just a visual representation of relationships.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah phylogenetic tree is a is a type of graph. Andrew Ippolito: And there's different ways to present these there's circular ones and there's horizontal and vertical or whatever, but the point is is the nodes Okay, the the contact points of the lines vertices represent species populations.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm really not that middle one there, so this shows a divergence here right, so there was some common ancestor and that ancestor diversion to two distinct populations.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and before it diverged with the story here is telling you is that, before it diverged that species here the common ancestor of everything above it had four limbs already.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we took this population of organisms and they radiated they covered they went to different places on the earth, they went to different environments and they lead their own lives and then over the years, they eventually specie through random changes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, this species over here on the Left eventually divergent to another set of species that became over time, the BAT and the mouse, and you can see here this little this little bar here that's when, according to the story the BAT learn to fly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so there was some common ancestor here that didn't fly and some of those individuals went off and came to be the MICE that we have today rodents redemption.\nAndrew Ippolito: and others of them became BATs. Andrew Ippolito: Which did learn to fly so there's flight of the BAT here, meanwhile, this population over here went along and eventually diverged into.\nAndrew Ippolito: birds and crocodiles right, so this is the common ancestor of the mammals.\nAnd reptiles. Andrew Ippolito: Wait I thought birds weren't reptiles, now they are now they change that.\nAngela Harbeck: weight, so the follow gigantic trans or whatever it's, just like the time, like the lines meaning something.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah the lines. Angela Harbeck: indicate time passage.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so example it might be. Andrew Ippolito: like this that long we just means a lot of time passed the short I mean it's it's pretty recent compared to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just basically like if you see the if you see a picture that's got weird lengths of lines that's the phylogenetic tree if, whereas the what i'm showing you here.\nAndrew Ippolito: everything's the same this there's no indicator like how long it took back to evolve that or how long might have been around that's just cloud Graham.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can see here, this was the divergence to the reptiles and mammals.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we now call these these are avian reptiles and non avian reptiles.\nthat's the new. Andrew Ippolito: lingo and taxonomy, and so we could say that the dinosaurs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are down here, actually, you know that that's overly simple so basically i'll say this bird modern birds are are the living survivors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of the Holocaust that killed the dinosaurs, they are dinosaurs they evolved in today's birds are yesterday's dinosaurs, they are sauropods the sauropod dinosaurs evolved into our modern D birds.\nAndrew Ippolito: They even had feathers are more and more we're learning that dinosaurs, there were a lot of feather dinosaurs, and so, if you go back and watch Jurassic Park, a lot of that stuff probably has to get edited now.\nTaylor Campbell: So, like, I do have a question. yeah.\nTaylor Campbell: isn't it true that we don't know what dinosaurs actually sounded like.\nTaylor Campbell: um what. Taylor Campbell: About birds, though, like birds don't scream.\nTaylor Campbell: Like you know they're like tweet tweet tweet so like two big dinosaur. Andrew Ippolito: Right right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now one thing we have, so I know, like the the. Taylor Campbell: duck old dinosaurs plesiosaurs.\nAndrew Ippolito: We we doing the simulations well i'll take the bones and they'll run simulation where the way air goes to them how they breathe and there'll be able to emulate probably.\nAndrew Ippolito: The way they sounded you know they like lead instruments like if somebody showed you a clarinet, but it was dead you forced air through it, you can probably simulate how it's supposed to sound so yeah we don't know exactly how they sounded like but based on their.\nAndrew Ippolito: Their their skeletal structures we can take good guesses at it, but yeah we will never know for sure, until we find something.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"The Tree of Life","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito presents a visual representation of the tree of life and discusses the concept of common ancestry.","start":"37:55","end":"45:20","content":"Taylor Campbell: With soft tissue and see what else was there, but like aren't they supposed to be related somehow like to hell bird sound yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sure, I mean if there are common ancestor but the outstanding question, there would just be you know bird song, the idea of bird song is that something that is unique to birds, just like, if you look over at the BATs right.\nTaylor Campbell: Only BATs flying and you sound similar. Taylor Campbell: kind of have that like that, but squeak enos.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah. Andrew Ippolito: So it's. Andrew Ippolito: very likely that dinosaurs sounded like modern birds a bit, but maybe.\nTaylor Campbell: Like deeper voices we doing. Taylor Campbell: Okay.\nAll right. Andrew Ippolito: So we're not going to spend any great amount of time learning about natural selection and this class that's bio to stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: However, evolution is the thread that connects everything, and so it is important for you to have a general awareness and understanding of how natural selection works, and so this is something that is actually in the curriculum.\nAndrew Ippolito: In kindergarten in the UK now every kid in the UK learns this stuff from day one in school that's that's how you fight scientific illiteracy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the acceptance of evolution theory by natural selection and America is still in an embarrassingly low number.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean again imagine people walking around saying they don't really believe in Adams that's where we are right now it's a little loopy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right now. Andrew Ippolito: The people who strongly don't believe in evolution there's only one group of people that dawn they're very, very religious.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's no atheist. Andrew Ippolito: evolution deniers it's very firmly rooted in and what some people would consider the mutual exclusion between science and religion, which is a logical fallacy, the two can exist just fine the Catholic Church acknowledges this happened.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have their on record saying something that, to paraphrase the last Pope, it would be ludicrous to deny the evidence of natural selection at this point.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they accept it. Andrew Ippolito: And the way they can go back to their religion is that God was the invisible hand guiding it all behind the scenes.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't disprove approve that that's fine. Andrew Ippolito: that's different than the people who deny it they're called the young earth creationists there's also old earth creationists but there's people that believe the Earth is about 5000 years old and that all species were were created as they are today and have not changed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just that's harder and harder to find those people, these days, but. Andrew Ippolito: Go ahead tell her. Taylor Campbell: Does that fall into the category of people that believe the Earth is flat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does it fall into the category of. Taylor Campbell: The people that believe the Earth is flat. Andrew Ippolito: know, although that's equally ridiculous, I mean yeah you know what, if you want to.\nAndrew Ippolito: You want to. Taylor Campbell: The world works differently, like gravity's different like gravity happens because, like we're falling like they have all kinds of strange things that they think so like do you think that would fall into the fact.\nAndrew Ippolito: That they do so. Andrew Ippolito: So you could. Andrew Ippolito: put all that on the realm of pseudoscience if you want. Andrew Ippolito: Okay um.\nAndrew Ippolito: or. Andrew Ippolito: Or you can put that into the method of. Andrew Ippolito: veracity i'm sorry tenacity. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so yeah, you have the flatter thurs you had the young earth creationists and then, and then you have the more complex subtle things like anti vax The anti vax crowd right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just take your vitamins. Andrew Ippolito: Like I do.\nAndrew Ippolito: My experience those people just tend to naturally they got lucky genetically and they're healthy and they also live a healthy lifestyle and so they have this idea that everybody can live like them and be healthy.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah and that falls into like when we were learning about like the belief like they refuse to believe it and the hackathon to again like how you're talking about the scientists that like.\nTaylor Campbell: Allegedly like said that it causes autism and then he came out to say that it wasn't true but they refuse to believe that that counteract.\nAndrew Ippolito: Exactly because the it just makes sense to them. Taylor Campbell: Right. Taylor Campbell: Okay, like limit themselves to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Exactly, and so there are people who are it just makes sense. Elizabeth Doebler: that the earth is 5000 years old.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's not true it's not it just makes sense it's so the Christian Bible has an entire book in it the big gets and there was this Irish priest many, many centuries ago, who did some math and calculated that it went from Adam to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Joseph so, and so we got that we got that we got that we got that and we got Joseph and then he had his 13 kids and they're all the tribes of canaan the canaanites and.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you do the math there and the average person live 200 years old well blah blah blah it 200 years old, what well that's in the Bible the older the older books of the Bible they believe that they measured years, not in solar years but in lunar years.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's pretty cool and so that's why you have people living to two or 300 years old, those are those are months really are 200 months old it's still it's do the math is still about 80 years old, so he was still an old guy it just not 200 old.\nAndrew Ippolito: The point is, is that they do that that's where the 5000 comes from there was this Irish priest there's a documentary about flat Earth is really yes, I began watching that and actually the first two or three minutes of it, I was like this watching it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like they're putting this on TV, I mean this is they're trying to actually build the case for flat earth this guy's actually trying to build the keys 40 standing in front of a lake saying look a flat, it is i'm like.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah what is. Elizabeth Doebler: an experiment gets completely like blown up at the end and it's like i'm you're wrong and then they're just like oh wow.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah so at the end of that the way. Andrew Ippolito: They come up with this idea, like so in order to prove that the earth is flat, we are going to buy this $25,000 laser interferometer thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're if the end we're gonna take measurements every 20 you know every hour for 24 hours, and if the divergence in the degree, is more than 15 degrees, the Earth is is round not flat.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if there is no divergence the Earth is flat so we're going to go into the experiment do the experiment it's 15 degrees it's exactly as predicted rounder like so they're doing the interview and he's like yeah so so that's a problem.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we're gonna keep at it and, like it just I, for I didn't. Elizabeth Doebler: bother with it no you're wrong the Earth is not flat.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah The thing is, is that guy made a lot of money and his. Andrew Ippolito: Followers he. Andrew Ippolito: He was making a lot of money he.\nAndrew Ippolito: actually put a cruise together for the flat earth crazy we're going to look at the end of the world up in the Arctic and that year, I remember telling my students if anybody goes, please take some pictures, for me, I really want to do with the end of the earth looks like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so here's how it works this there's nothing magical about this, you have an individual group of organisms of the same species you got population within that population there's variations.\nAndrew Ippolito: All populations have variations that's part of life right if you just look at us on the zoom channel, we got different color hair different.\nAndrew Ippolito: different skin tones we all have different metabolisms right we're just physically we're different you can do this whole way down to yourselves if you're looking under the microscope at a group of cells like your skin cells Those are all different to right there's variation and populations.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Polyphyletic and Paraphyletic Groups","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concepts of polyphyletic and paraphyletic groups in systematics.","start":"45:20","end":"51:40","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Number two not all offspring survive We live in a finite resource environment it's the concept here is called scarcity.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the context of scarcity, not everybody makes it.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you have scarce resources, not all the offspring are survive Darwin when he first started putting this together and thinking about it did this quick little back of the envelope calculation on elephants.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he said, if I take two elephants and they have you know, on average, they have three children over the course of their decades of life, he did some quick math and he said the earth should be covered an elephant within 200 years and clearly that's not the case.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, he did an experiment in his yard, it was called the because we'd garden he actually had a garden of weeds who has a weed garden darling did.\nAndrew Ippolito: Before Darwin postulated this most people assumed that that the earth was this wonderful beautifully balanced paradise that everything was there for a reason, when the pilgrims first came to America.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we started going out in the woods and they discovered these whole swaths of farm they found crops growing for them, they thought God put them all they're.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not the Indians that were decimated by plake that then died.\nAndrew Ippolito: So he thought it was all sculpted exactly for them it's very interesting that's very interesting story, too, so the idea is is that the earth isn't this perfect balanced, harmonious.\nAndrew Ippolito: system and when Darwin did was he took very detailed notes, he planted some seeds in the earth and then every day he visited them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he kept a notebook on them day one seat number seven was eaten by a mouse day three seedling number 14 you know, had some kind of weird blight and then it died.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, only a few of them survived from the originals and that's where he started coming up with this idea to. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so have the offspring that do survive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some of them, not all of them, some of them survive a little bit better because of those better they had natural variations that were more suited to that environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And right there that's that's the key there. Andrew Ippolito: Some of them survive because of their natural variations and those that do survive pass on those variations to the next.\nAndrew Ippolito: To the next group. Andrew Ippolito: The next generation. Andrew Ippolito: And those who don't perish and you just keep doing that, over and over and over and over and over for hundreds and hundreds and thousands and thousands of millions and millions of generations.\nAndrew Ippolito: And slowly and surely adaptation occurs this isn't something that happened now we have observed this happen and it's in so, for example, there was a species of lizard.\nAndrew Ippolito: That they had to transplant from one island to another, the spec like this 60s to let it survive and they let it live on that island and they revisited it something like 20 years later, back in the 80s.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when they researching it an autopsy showed that the stomach developed a brand new valve.\nAndrew Ippolito: Within something like the calculated on my 30 generations, they were just popping new valve in their.\nNew species of rows of lizard. The stomach bowels lizard I don't know.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when Darwin visit the Galapagos Islands and he found all these finches living all over the place.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he had a childhood, where he was good, with hunting, he would he was a hunter he likes shooting you know and hunting animals and so he collected a whole bunch of birds and he would he would you know.\nAndrew Ippolito: treat them, however, he was supposed to jump ship them back to England during his five year voyage, he was just shipping things back to England, the whole time.\nAndrew Ippolito: There was this one ornithologist friend of his and when he got back to England and he talked to that ornithologist is ornithologist friend was like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you realize all of these birds are different species now he was you know, looking at their anatomy and and Darren was like why and that's what made him start thinking like he assumed, these are just you know one population, a bird.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not all these different species that could not intermix. Andrew Ippolito: And that's the idea you start connecting all the dots here and it's like so in the islands different habitats, they had different kinds of seeds, the other beaks were shaped a little differently.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we now learn they have different ton of bird song right there's all these changes that occur.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so that's it that's that's evolution by natural selection, if you think of dogs it's the same exact idea, except we're deciding which dogs breed okay artificial selection humans pick mom and dad natural selection, the environment, PICs mom and dad.\nit's that simple. Angela Harbeck: Then it happened with us like because I know I work in a nursing home and like half the resins that I work with they say that they had like six kids.\nAngela Harbeck: And i'm like geez. Andrew Ippolito: So we live in a very well actually with a pandemic, we don't anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: What I used to say was We live in a very safe, healthy environment where it's kind of hard to die now, and you know, the average American our lifespans are.\nAndrew Ippolito: they've now shortened for the first time in decades from from the pandemic, but we still pretty good let's say before antibiotics before germ theory.\nTaylor Campbell: But you know if you go back to like the 1820s. Andrew Ippolito: When you still have people not washing their hands in between the maternity Ward and the cadaver pit they the life expectancy was in the 30s.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our life expectancy has been in the 30s for thousands of years.\nAndrew Ippolito: You were an elder I would be an elder. Taylor Campbell: listen to me children i've seen things right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Most of us would be dead. Andrew Ippolito: i've actually probably be dead myself my wife would be dead she had jack was breached, when he was born, she would have blood out and died I probably would have died, too."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Horizontal Gene Transfer","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses horizontal gene transfer and its impact on the web of life.","start":"51:40","end":"58:00","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Most of us would be dead.

Andrew Ippolito: yeah What would you say to her. Taylor Campbell: Like it's because that we have the technology now like we laugh.\nAndrew Ippolito: And sing on the medicine. Andrew Ippolito: and your practices we wash your hands, we we understand germ theory we try to avoid getting sick.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah but we got that because of our intelligence grow. Andrew Ippolito: Right right.\nTaylor Campbell: Like they don't have that like advantage. Andrew Ippolito: They don't need it.\nTaylor Campbell: Right, they can yeah. Andrew Ippolito: So, if anything, we've kind of grown beyond.\nAndrew Ippolito: The normal boundaries of natural selection right now we're still evolving don't don't mistake that humanity still above everything evolves over time it's just what what the the pressures and the stresses are different now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so the reason why we now have glasses and stomach problems and migraines and all sorts of these just a little annoying things of life, those are accumulation of deleterious mutations that happened about six every generation.\nAndrew Ippolito: were those are starting to catch up to us. Andrew Ippolito: The same reason why most dog breeds tend to have kind of stuff going on with them, like last opposite kidney problems.\nAndrew Ippolito: And dalmatians or death right it's all the inbreeding and for us it's allowing the that not allowing but enabling.\nAndrew Ippolito: More and more children to survive into adulthood, and to have children themselves that in the past wouldn't have been able to because they would have died from calera or anthrax or diphtheria, or one of them, you know pick your poison.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right we're the first generation, we are among the first generations to survive as long as we do.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that there are so many people over the age of 60 has never happened on earth before and our bodies don't know what to do, that's one of the fun things too is like my body at 45 years old.\nAndrew Ippolito: everything that happens after this there's no precedent and evolution for it, we just slowly kind of wear out like the martian Rovers that are up there still taking pictures.\nAndrew Ippolito: They had they were supposed to be done, years ago, but they're still up there right it's a my shoulder kind of wore out a little bit, and I know this car well you're still got a shoulder just that's not enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we lose the muscles in our eyes, we lose the ability to focus that's why we need reading glasses, you know our tendons and ligaments start to get a little more desiccated and they don't fix themselves as quickly anymore our skin starts to dry out a little bit aging sucks.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so my mom had a really good you know when I was like bitching and moaning about getting older she's like think about how lucky or.\nAndrew Ippolito: Am I This is like the hall I eat your vegetables there's people starving in other parts of the world. Andrew Ippolito: Like Well, no, I mean you're still alive, you know and you're gonna keep being alive yeah you get older, but you get to experience, more and more and more like you keep getting to experience things.\nDanuta Despagne: that's cool um my great grandma lives like 200.\nDanuta Despagne: wow yeah she and she was like still like a little bit active to the day she died so she would walk even at her 90s 97 to walk to church.\nDanuta Despagne: But she lived like what a mappings so she was used to like active work so she just was healthy throughout her whole entire life and stuff so she knew she died at 100.\nAndrew Ippolito: wow. Andrew Ippolito: yeah they say that i'm healthy lifestyle gets you to 70 and that your genes get you to ED and beyond, you can be the healthiest person in the world, but if you just got bad genes.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know congestive heart failure brain starting to go it's just you can do everything in the world and it'll still catch up to you if you're unlucky enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so that's good that that whole being able to live to become a centurion I think that's what they call them century ins.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's genetic my my great uncle john led to about 9495 and the only reason he passed away was when he was in the hospital for something he got sepsis the doctors messed up then give them, you know he accidentally got an infectious disease, they took him out.\nAndrew Ippolito: But if he didn't get that. Andrew Ippolito: He was still lucid he was playing the horse track race stuff and he was just his mind was chubby was telling us, the last time I met him I got my kids got to meet him.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah we went up to visit on good john and he was telling us stories when he was in his 20s back in New York City grew up in the in the city and.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was just he just remembered it like was yesterday still I hope I got those jeans.\nDanuta Despagne: yeah like in my family, the women live longer than the men usually so they like some most of the women live like pastor 70 8090 was the manager that like diner 15th which is sad but.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah that's good. Good. Andrew Ippolito: So they also say that in today that the first person to live to 1000 years old, is already alive today.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where they are now we're that within the next couple of decades we're going to be able to extend human life, to the point where we're not going to die of natural causes anymore, the only thing it's going to take us out are things like car accidents and.\nAndrew Ippolito: guns I don't know like unnatural cause of death, but not your body failing and their way there they they approach, this is they see death natural cell death as a disease.\nAndrew Ippolito: Instead of as an inevitable consequence so 105 oh my God and that's the best would be like, if you have people in your life that are up there, like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Take your phone start recording and just ask them questions about their life they capture that stuff my mom did that to her grandfather.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can find the damn tapes like wanted to listen to them, but she listened to them enough, where she could tell me stories, those are i'll tell you those stories some other time my great grandpa was it's almost like he was indiana Jones character is kind of crazy.\nAndrew Ippolito: So Okay, so at the end of the day here natural selection is the only thing that makes sense and biology and you can connect it in the same way that we do atomic theory newtonian mechanics and whatnot for physics right, this is the thing that connects everything.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"The Last Universal Common Ancestor","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the concept of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and the origin of life.","start":"58:00","end":"1:03:00","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Which is why it's ridiculous that people don't accept.

Andrew Ippolito: Where are we with time here we're almost out of time what time does our class officially end.\nAndrew Ippolito: One oh good we're almost out of time, all right, you guys okay to keep going if you're not you can go take a break, if you need it, but okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: I gotta keep going I don't have to keep going, I have to keep going systematics, this is a, this is a science unto itself, you could become systematised someday system artists or people who concern themselves with the tree of life itself and trying to put all the parts together.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so there's two things going on here there's there's your name. Andrew Ippolito: How, you name something like i'm Andrew Joseph dippolito.\nPhD. Andrew Ippolito: Is a little thing at the end now that's kind of Nice right that's that's me Okay, I am currently it's just impress assistant professor of biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the you know stem department of books kind of chemical that's my classification that's not my own classification i'm also dad right and i'm also husband i'm also friend.\nAndrew Ippolito: must have dungeon master i'm all these different things.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can change that you can change the classifications, I am I played d&d.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm running a few campaigns right now. Andrew Ippolito: And, and so that's the difference between what we call binomial nomenclature, which is how we name biological organisms we classify them as a species, we named them according to their classifications their their genus and species it's like we're homosapien.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so binomial nomenclature is your name your name never changes. Andrew Ippolito: If we uncover new relationships that shift things around on the family tree, the name stays the same, but the categories might differ that's why I told you not like birds are now reptiles.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the names of those pieces of the birds are still the same okay so there's naming and there's classifying we're going to see this in chemistry to we have the names of the elements right, we have the names of different organic compounds are different compounds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like you know ethanol, and then we have the periodic table right how we organize it all we classify them, you know you got your your your halogens and your noble gases and whatever okay in biology, the way we categorize things we use two different tools.\nAndrew Ippolito: taxonomy is the tool we've used since the 1600s starting with Charles linnaeus or linnaeus.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: taxonomy is a system we use based upon morphological differences morphology is what we look like our physical differences so, for example, arthropods have segments and their bodies.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so to do analysts the segmented worms and so according to taxonomy the analysts and the arthropods or sister groups.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in contrast, fila genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: is a means to connect the family trees, based on. Andrew Ippolito: Their relationships with each other evolutionarily.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the deeper one, this is the more accurate one it's also the harder one to use, because you have to have sequence information available.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whether it's at the DNA level or the RNA level, and when we put those DNA sequence comparisons together school comparative genomics we can start to build family trees, based on the differences within the codes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that that there's a whole science on to that you know which genes do I use which punch the genome into a PIC.\nAndrew Ippolito: If i'm using RNA which rnas do I pick well that's you know we're not going to go into any of that this semester just we're just going to become aware that this is a field of science called file genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can't just do file genetics, or just taxonomy right because you can't do file genetics on organisms, you know sequences to like any dinosaur most dinosaurs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right likewise i'm sure that we found you know DNA sequences in the remains of animals, you know stomachs or whatever, and we don't necessarily have a skeleton to show.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"Conclusion and Q&A","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito concludes the lecture and answers questions from the audience.","start":"1:03:00","end":"1:08:00","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right so together we use these two tools in the toolkit of systematics okay that ultimately has the goal of building a tree of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a very ambitious goal. Andrew Ippolito: Okay it's gonna take both the extinct.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: extent organisms and put them all into a tree so there's a new word for you, for some of you extent is the opposite of extinct humans or an extent species.\nFor now. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: questions. Andrew Ippolito: it's making sense. Alexa Deprisco: alright. Andrew Ippolito: So there is this go ahead, go ahead.\nAlexa Deprisco: I lived on it says what includes extinct versus extent.\nAlexa Deprisco: or both them do. Andrew Ippolito: systematics does systematics. Alexa Deprisco: Does yeah. Andrew Ippolito: systematics is the study.\nAlexa Deprisco: Of the tree of life that's one way to say it. Andrew Ippolito: And within systematics, and so the goal of systematics is to put together that family tree of everything living in depth and the way we do that is through taxonomy and filer genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah so careful like that you said follow gen X I mix this up all the time, so there's the word file lodge and he.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then there's fellow genetics. Andrew Ippolito: And we call them they're not phylogenetic trees they're phylogenetic trees.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'm still you know I probably have to read about these words a little bit more to to figure out the relationships between but phylogenetic.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a word we use to describe common ancestry this fellow gigantic tree is a tree of common ancestry.\nOkay. Taylor Campbell: So you're saying i'm sorry, one more time, what was the systematics they could.\nAndrew Ippolito: Follow genetics. Andrew Ippolito: Is the study of phylogenetic, I guess, maybe that's how we can say that's the relationship.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, I don't know if i'm going to buy this but i'm just reading this on one definition phylogenetic is the evolutionary history of groups and organisms, such as species or leads.\nAndrew Ippolito: So clubs or groups of species, while follow genetics, is the systematic study of organisms relation organism relationships based on evolutionary similarities and differences.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: I guess, I can see that so when we when we compare sequences really Oh, these are just these sequences are different and that's why they're in different clouds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but here, but again, this I don't want to go too deep into this rabbit hole, this is bio to stuff that you just have to be kind of vaguely aware of right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: This isn't going to impact too much of our work together so understand phylogenetic trees, the chapter 26 level material that I assigned just that stuff okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so there it is there's there's a nice representation of the tree of life it's a web and notice that there's, not a single common ancestor but there's a population of them.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And most species haven't even been identified right the big stuffs been identified the easy to find stuff has been identified for the most part.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, but the the bacteria and the insects there's more species of beetle than there is anything else is 350,000 species of beetles alone.\nAndrew Ippolito: There was this. Andrew Ippolito: interview with some evolutionist back in years and years ago and researcher was saying, like.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you could ask or, if you could say something about the mind of God, as you know, creating all this if if God put it all together what would you what would you say, and he was a British guy he's like.\nAndrew Ippolito: All say God, really, really like Beatles.\nBeatles alright. Andrew Ippolito: So when we say nomenclature there's not nomenclature, is not a biology word, this is just a generic English word nomenclature, is when when you have any.\nAndrew Ippolito: Technical system where there's chemistry or auto mechanics the nomenclature of the field is the words and the definitions that are specific to that field right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you don't know the nomenclature of a given field and you're listening to people who do talk, you might understand some English words in there, but you're not gonna really have any idea what they're talking about.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's nomenclature okay and there's your cleats and clatter Graham, so this is a circular cloud ground.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 1 (Part 2) - Order To Life","link":"https://youtu.be/LyaHhsXlouQ?si=S-xy_fj66ofMMZ19","chunkTitle":"The System","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the system and the most efficient way to package all the different states the system can be in.","start":"1:29:14","end":"1:29:28","content":"Andrew Ippolito: The system.

Andrew Ippolito: This is a joke quiz So the idea, there is a you know the reason why the ferns not happy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is because they don't breathe oxygen right they they give off the oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, i've already given you this one i'll skip that one there's here's the beginning of today, one does not simply breakdown glucose, it is not a simple process by any stretch of the imagination.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you don't get that reference you haven't watched Lord of the Rings and really this meme is like 10 years old now actually it's it's 10 years old, now I rewatch this movie recently and I realized it came out 10 years ago.\nAndrew Ippolito: I felt so old. Andrew Ippolito: I still remember opening night anyway well this one once I told a chemistry joke, there was no reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah I got some smarts that's good enough all right, and what if I told you this citric acid cycle happens in the matrix.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's where that's where happens remember the mitochondria the inside of the mitochondria called the matrix and that's where.\nAndrew Ippolito: It happens anyway alright, so this is we're not going to go through this, this is what we're going to do today, or at least we're going to get through, about half of this today and we're going to finish it on Wednesday.\nAndrew Ippolito: And just as a perspective here you the average human adult requires about 2200 kilocalories of energy, a day, just to maintain the status quo and about three quarters of that energy goes to just being you can be in bed all day you're still going to burn 75% of the energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: 25% gets used for physical. activity. Andrew Ippolito: Right, just think about that for a second right, so one of the most common fallacies of people who think they have to go on a diet to lose weight.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or rather, that they have to exercise a lot to lose weight it turns out exercise doesn't contribute so much to weight loss as opposed to diet diet is everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: exercise is essential for this for for our brains health.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's good for our immune system and getting our lymphatic systems moving and stuff but as so from purely from our perspective of losing weight as as Americans who are sit entry and we eat terribly high calorie foods.\nAndrew Ippolito: The strategy needs to focus more on the dietary aspects and less on the exercise aspects, it turns out, in other words, you can do all the exercise in the world, but if your diet sucks you're still going to be overweight.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's a whole bunch of psychology there too, as you exercise more your metabolism goes up you get hungrier and so we've all for those of us who exercise we all feel like oh I just ran five miles i'm going to reward myself and eat all this pizza.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay right and i've been there myself many times right the trick is just don't eat so much Andrew and you won't have your bumble it."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Calories and Energy Reserves","chunkSummary":"The lecturer discusses the concept of calories and kilocalories, explaining the measurement of energy in food.

Andrew Ippolito: And the reason why we have calories versus kilocalories right so there's capital C calorie versus lower case calorie the capital C calorie we call food calorie, and this is just to convert it's the same reason why we don't measure.\nAndrew Ippolito: car efficiency in inches per gallon. Andrew Ippolito: Right, I mean how how fuel efficient or car Oh, I get 200 billion inches per gallon but you mean.\nAndrew Ippolito: 30 miles per gallon that makes more sense right it's just our brains uncomprehending thing so.\nAndrew Ippolito: we measure the food calories is thousands of calories because everything has hundreds of thousands of calories.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it's just scaling it up and instead of saying kilocalories because apparently the American public isn't equipped to handle the metric system in any way we just call it a calorie again but make it get a capital C.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's funny. Taylor Campbell: Like tell people who are like complete health nuts.\nTaylor Campbell: That and that's how many calories you eat like yeah like that's how much you need point it's just my one friend like he's like always counting and counting calories like complete like nut job and like I told him that he, like lost his mind.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah most people don't realize that your brain needs a tremendous amount of energy to do this every day work, and so, if you're starving yourself you're actually going to if you're particularly starving yourself you're going to suffer mental consequences, it is important to realize that.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are more States are doing remember science replaced by better science right, so the current science very suggests that when when you go into starvation mode when you live in a calorie restricted lifestyle that seems, at least in mouse models to really extend longevity.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: mice on diets that are calorie restricted live much longer than mice that are not calorie restricted, which is really interesting, so I guess feeding all these blueberries to the ball is just speeding up the inevitable demise.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are you doing there you still there yep there is, I put a towel over him, so I don't see him during the day, because I figured i'm going to get distracted otherwise he lives right next to me and I was.\nTaylor Campbell: wondering why you put that on there about there is a good reason. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah it's because of. Andrew Ippolito: My own add if I saw him just costing moving around.\nAndrew Ippolito: to teach you guys. Andrew Ippolito: But also, I think he you know they're borrowing. Andrew Ippolito: mammals, so I have a feeling that by keeping that on there he's a he feels like he's underground and safe.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas I put them in the sink is terrified you know when I clean, I was cage I go and put them in the sink and he's got he does is cocked head, I think.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's looking up at me with just was like runs around, and I think he's looking for hawks and now's because you know they everything eats them and so they're just terrified out in the open right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like being in a war zone we're both going everywhere, as far as he's concerned, so I think he's he's feeling less anxious and i'm not being distracted until just now.\nJulia Lakchin: Are you gonna take him to the vet. Andrew Ippolito: uh well again I caught him he's probably at the end of his life, to begin with i'm just kind of it's like a hospice situation, I think.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because again their lifespan is three months and he's an adult so he's probably at least one to two months old so he's already a geriatric patient, so to speak.\nAndrew Ippolito: Although he's getting better and the other thing is yeah I looked this up you can't do anything for the textbook as Moses Gandhi, or whatever it's called.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're in they're not going to do anything for a bowl i'm going to hand it to them and they're going to say thank you and then just anesthetize them, I mean he's it's evolved it's or the film to a snake, you know they're.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are not high priority animals but they're not endangered their their pest creatures, if you have a garden at home, these these would be things you hate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because they'll eat they basically they eat the roots of any succulent plan or any little baby plant, they will just destroy your garden, and they multiply really, really quickly so.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah so now i'm not taking into a bit, but he's he's he's okay he's just he just wanted to start close.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, all right good calories.

Andrew Ippolito: And we're going to break it down into carbon dioxide and water and we're going to pull that energy out in the process.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, think of it as a series of redux reactions."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Overview of Cellular Respiration","chunkSummary":"The lecturer provides an overview of cellular respiration, highlighting the multiple pathways involved in the breakdown of glucose.

Andrew Ippolito: So, here it is and a couple of different ways, your book and some other books, but the idea is the same we're going to take a high energy molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're gonna oxidize it to low energy molecules and what we're gonna do is we're going to use glucose as an example.\nAndrew Ippolito: glucose so you can do this to amino acids, you can do this, the fatty acids, you can do this too fast Phillip is in theory Okay, the only thing we don't generally use as a fuel source or nucleic acids, because they're they're toxic they have all that nitrogen and.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we don't eat DNA and RNA I mean we do there in our foods, but we don't extract the energy from them, we have to deal with them, in contrast, the proteins, the lipids and the sugars.\nAndrew Ippolito: We extract energy, out of all those, and there is a pecking order and the pecking order is from sugars to fats or lipids to proteins your body, the mammalian anatomy prefers it in this order.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so everyday life is all about sugar in the blood when we go into starvation mode we start tapping into our fat reserves, if there are no fat reserves, we start cutting into our muscle.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the human that is starving somebody who has gone weeks and weeks and weeks, but now nutrition and that doesn't get enough calories routinely.\nAndrew Ippolito: They will be literal skin and bones, they will have just muscle no fat and then, then what happens is they start getting a guest build up in their stomach and that's why they have that inflamed stomach.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's gas that's not. Andrew Ippolito: fat. Andrew Ippolito: that's when you know you're on the last legs of approaching a lethal situation you can go about a month, without eating food, you can only go a few days without water.\nAndrew Ippolito: know, though, if you do go a month, without food you'll probably suffer permanent neurological damage and liver damage it does all sorts of really, really nasty things that happens in the process of long term starvation.\nAngela Harbeck: isn't it like if you don't eat like a pretty sure I learned this with like the Holocaust and when they started to try to eat again like you can like your body's not used to it, so you have to work yourself up to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Again yeah yeah if you take somebody. Andrew Ippolito: That is true, if you take somebody who's starving, for a long period of time you give them like a big MAC.\nAndrew Ippolito: they'll just bombing it right up they can't they're there because the enzymes are all shut off they their bodies are conserving their energy right so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because they've gone so long without breaking anything remember we haven't. Andrew Ippolito: Seen remember the lack operand I covered that my micro class there's this idea of controlling gene regulation right so.\nAndrew Ippolito: When there's nothing there to break down, it would waste energy to make the enzymes to break them down so we stopped making the enzymes yeah so you so you gear it up slowly over a period of days.\nAndrew Ippolito: Water first simple sugars i'm by no means an expert in any of this but that's.\nTaylor Campbell: A hunger cues turn off to. Andrew Ippolito: say again. Taylor Campbell: Your hunger cues.\nAndrew Ippolito: But. Taylor Campbell: Your brain like telling you like i'm hungry. Taylor Campbell: Oh yeah yeah yeah hunger cues they turn off because it's a waste of energy, since you're not.\nTaylor Campbell: lydia right your body like well he's that. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah sure I learned about when I was teaching the anatomy class last semester, I learned about your primary and secondary insulin response.\nAndrew Ippolito: So insulin is a hormone that takes sugars out of your blood and puts them into your liver that's how we, you know so when you eat a lot the insulin takes that sugar and stores it for you right that's a good thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, people who are diabetic their either their type one they don't make insulin or Type two they're they're basically so addicted to insulin that they're not responsive to the normal amounts of it anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, but when you smell something good right we've all had that we salivate and it turns out, we also have an insulin response we kick in our insulin levels, and so one of the issues with diet soda This is something i've learned empirically I used to be addicted to diet coke or diet Pepsi.\nAndrew Ippolito: I noticed that diet sodas would make me sleepy and I think what was happening was the sweetness of it would trigger my primary.\nAndrew Ippolito: insulin response and so insulin start getting kicked on but then there's no sugars that are flooding my blood because that's a diet soda, and so the insulin would take what sugars are in the blood and pull them out, and then I would get sleepy.\nAndrew Ippolito: almost like a sugar crash. Andrew Ippolito: So I stopped drinking so much soda and when I do drink soda drink normal soda which isn't healthy either, but you know everybody's got their thing right.\nAndrew Ippolito: But I do notice that the lethargic part one away. Andrew Ippolito: Anyway, yeah So if you like this stuff This is all the realm of physiology if you want to you know dig into that from an academic perspective, you take a MP, one and a MP and you'll learn all this stuff and then nutrition there's a nutrition class, you can take to."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Mitochondria and Electron Carriers","chunkSummary":"The lecturer discusses the role of mitochondria in cellular respiration and the importance of electron carriers in transporting high-energy electrons within the cell.

Andrew Ippolito: Now let's imagine.\nAndrew Ippolito: That you haven't eaten in weeks. Andrew Ippolito: you're lost in the woods and you just didn't eat anything you didn't forage for berries or anything you're just too stressed right, so you get out of the woods, you get rescued, and they put you in the nearest diner and they stick a single chicken wing in front of you.\nAndrew Ippolito: crispy and hot. Andrew Ippolito: A little side of blue cheese and, of course, you start salivating you haven't eaten weeks right, and you can imagine how you're going to eat that chicken wing, even if you don't like chicken wings you're going to eat the chicken wing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Even if it's like diametrically opposed your philosophies on life you're starving and this is food.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so you're going to eat all of the skin all the bone not all the bonds you're gonna eat all the meat off the bus, and you know it gets the point where you are going to eat all the little weird ligament stuff that usually nobody pays attention to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your you get to the point where you have that bone you're going to crack it in half, then you're going to suck the marrow out of the bugs know you you've never been starving.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't know no I don't either by but the idea is is there is untapped energy reserves.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's hard and hard to get to it. Andrew Ippolito: right that first bites the easiest.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know a few bites and then again if you're in a land of plenty and you're just you have 1000 wings you're not that hungry, you might take a bite or two and throw man, because you just like the good parts.\nAndrew Ippolito: right but let's say you only have three wings because you're sharing now you're gonna eat you're going to take time to get to all that little harder to get me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and if you're truly starving you're going to start to access to stuff deep that's hard to get to.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what we're going to see here is there's a quick burn like costs, this is easy and fast everybody does it the products of that are like a chicken bone.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, for bacteria that don't go through cell respiration.\nAndrew Ippolito: For bacteria that just do great causes that's the end of their story they don't get a lot of energy out of the original glucose molecule the only like 2% of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the presence of oxygen we're going to tap into that bone marrow and we're going to see that that's where the good stuff is it turns out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's the end of the analogy bone marrow doesn't have any particular green energy reserve in real life it's not like you should really.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know it's not encouraging you to use bone marrow but that's that's the analogy here that's the untapped potential is for glucose as energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to see that, in the presence of oxygen when we take that by product by rho V we're going to be able to get up to 30% of the energy out instead of a measly to that translates to instead of to ATP 30 ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so the idea here is if we're inefficient if there are metabolic process, so the reason why metabolic process multiple steps is to maximize the efficiency of the energy extraction.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the same way, our car is fuel efficient and we just were that. Andrew Ippolito: That little buzz of the spark plug blows up just a little bit of the gas in your tank at a time that's in the cylinder of your engine, and that is what allows us to drive forward and instead of getting a foot out of 30 gallons we can get 300 miles out of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: or more. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and of course cookie monster is the least efficient of these.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why. Andrew Ippolito: Because he's a muppet you don't actually eat anything zero.\nAndrew Ippolito: All that all that foods going to waste every cookie that that woman's putting in front of him 100% i'm going to waste.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right.

Andrew Ippolito: We call this the energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Different books called different things let's call it the energy liberation fees.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we're going to do here. Andrew Ippolito: And another series of I think those are three reactions, this is when we're going to take our nav.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's two of them. Andrew Ippolito: are going to pick up that energy here.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're also going to make ATP in a way we've never made it before the last time you've seen making ATP we used a proton gradient and ATP synthesis and cranked it out.\nAndrew Ippolito: What we're going to do here is we're going to use this molecules of substrate phosphorylation so this called substrate level phosphorylation we're going to take a dp.\nAndrew Ippolito: and make ATP and we're going to make four of those in this process here. Andrew Ippolito: Rather than you some in organophosphates but we're going to basically rip those phosphates off.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's a source of phosphate until we call this substrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: level. Andrew Ippolito: Fast for relation Okay, so this is a unique way to make ATP that you haven't seen yet through for metabolic pathway basically instead of a proton gradient.\nAndrew Ippolito: Again we call number the file acquired we fill up the protons and then we have the ATP synthesis and these flow downhill, and we make ATP this is different than that.\nAndrew Ippolito: That was the only way you've made up before we're not doing it that way we're doing instead using enzymes and substitutes so it's called substrate level phosphorylation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we don't make that much of it we're just making we're making, for we use to so we we say we net to right we used to in the first phase above we made for for a total of two."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Fermentation","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito describes fermentation as an alternative pathway in glucose metabolism that occurs in the absence of oxygen, allowing for the regeneration of NAD+.","start":"39:32","end":"45:16","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And we don't make that much of it we're just making we're making, for we use to so we we say we net to right we used to in the first phase above we made for for a total of two.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so the final product here of the energy liberation phase.

Alexa Deprisco: Okay, so look for ATP that our input and then they're related to ATP so the energy that is needed to do that is that coupled when the na de turns in na de you.\nAndrew Ippolito: know the energy. Andrew Ippolito: To create the CPS. Andrew Ippolito: comes from the free energy within the GDP molecule itself and the BP G so there's.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have. Andrew Ippolito: And then you have be P G that's bisphosphonate glossary and then you have the fast food goes around behind or the three PG.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so that the energy, those are high energy to low energy molecules so we're giving up each one of those conversions as an extra ganache reaction and we capture some of that energy in the ATP.\nAlexa Deprisco: So and i'm. Alexa Deprisco: So again, so I was gonna say so, like that's all happening like that breakdown is happening it's releasing energy, which is like forcing the phosphorylation.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah you got it. Andrew Ippolito: yeah so there's enzymes, the enzymes take that free energy and staple the phosphate group on to the dp you've got it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And again, all of this is happening in the absence of oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Any other questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. let's. Andrew Ippolito: Now look so i'm going to just summarize that again i'm just going to doodle the the carbons oh and go to the next step here 123456123123 art So here we are in the cytoplasm now over here there's a mitochondrial membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's the inner membrane and the outer membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's think about oxygen Now this is where we we fork into two parallel universes here we're either going to do something without oxygen when you do something without oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in the presence of oxygen plus two.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to see the pirates. Andrew Ippolito: Get pumped.\nAndrew Ippolito: into the mitochondrial matrix.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the presence of oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're also going to see you remember the ncd page that we made.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm sorry any do. Andrew Ippolito: The two of them again and the presence of oxygen we're gonna see don't worry about any of the details here, this is going to come into the matrix now because that's where we're going to use it later.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it and it has two possible feats either when everything is said and done, it remains as nadh.\nAndrew Ippolito: or. Andrew Ippolito: In some. Andrew Ippolito: overly complicated process we're not going to learn about it ends up as F ED.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the electrons find themselves in the matrix one way or another, from the cytoplasm they're useless Alma cytoplasm there's nothing we can do with them in the cytoplasm useful because we're going to see.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to recall now in this way I teach photosynthesis First I want you to think of photo system to grabbing the sunlight.\nAndrew Ippolito: pumping that electrons full of energy and then handing those energies off or handing those electrodes off to the electron transport chain right high energy electrons being handed to achieve.\nAndrew Ippolito: These things do the same thing that the photo system does it hands those high energy love to change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that changes in the matrix but it's really it's it's in the Christine membrane here.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we're not we're not focusing on that detail just yet, I just want you to show in your notes and in your brains right now we're going to put those things to work, the only place, they can go to useful work is here in the matrix and you can only get there in the presence of oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the absence of oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: In instead, what happens is we're just going to dump that energy we're going to waste it by dumping it into magically of course onto this movie."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Preparatory Reaction","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the preparatory reaction, which converts acetyl CoA into citric acid in preparation for the Krebs cycle.","start":"45:16","end":"47:45","content":"Andrew Ippolito: In the absence of oxygen.

Andrew Ippolito: That any D.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what fermentation is. Andrew Ippolito: So fermentation think of fermentation as an extension of glide calluses that only occurs in the absence of oxygen and its goal is to regenerate that free any D, so that I can keep like calls is going in empties the bucket.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the products of that depend on say products.\nAndrew Ippolito: depend. Andrew Ippolito: On.\nAndrew Ippolito: The genetics. Andrew Ippolito: depends on which enzymes are present so we're going to learn about lactic acid fermentation or ethanol fermentation you don't have to know the details just yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not all happens in the absence of oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: And again there's no new energy formed there's no more efficiencies there's no additionally tps all it does is it frees up that nadh to go and continue the work of like cutlasses.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's a sustainable cycle. Andrew Ippolito: So, in other words that any dh is wasted.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a waste of energy. Andrew Ippolito: it's a chicken wing with one bite taken out of it that you're throwing away.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's horribly inefficient fermentation is is an inefficient process but it keeps the cell a lot.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now let's pick up that story with the presence of oxygen let's go into the mitochondria here. Andrew Ippolito: The first thing we're going to do to these three carbon molecules is we're going to get them ready for their final death and the Krebs cycle i'm going to prep them this is literally called the preparatory reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your book does not list this as a formal step in the process, I do in my notes in my lectures my powerpoints this is formally my step two."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Krebs Cycle","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains the Krebs cycle, a series of chemical reactions that further oxidize acetyl CoA and produce NADH, FADH2, and ATP.","start":"47:45","end":"1:02:46","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Your book does not list this as a formal step in the process, I do in my notes in my lectures my powerpoints this is formally my step two.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it's just a single but it's a simple enough thing where your book just kind of sees it as a middle layer between glycol assists and the Krebs cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's semantics, you have to worry about it, the thing here is we're going to oxidize this pirate movie.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you can also think of this step as pie rouvier veit oxidation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the enzymes name appropriately is called pi Ruby.\nAndrew Ippolito: dehydrogenase.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your book teaches you this and i'll say it out loud now a dehydrogenase enzyme is an enzyme that oxidizes things.\nAndrew Ippolito: So whenever you see the word dehydrogenase you're thinking redux.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we're gonna do is we're going to pop off one of those carbons So here we have a two carbon molecule now and a free carbon and that free carbon that's carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, of course, this happens twice right, we have to have these molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: And these are a gas. Andrew Ippolito: And these diffuse.\nAndrew Ippolito: away and we breathe them out that's the carbon dioxide you're exhaling right now, this is one of the places we generate the carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to consider the carbon accounting Now we have this initial six carbon molecule that broke down into two three carbon molecules and now we have liberated, to have the original six, we still have four of the original six to deal with.\nAndrew Ippolito: These turn out to be that's that's vinegar that's acidic acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, of course, if that's that's not the end of the story with these we're going to take those those are now the chicken bone with the bone marrow trapped inside this is the last vestiges of energy we're going to grab.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what we're gonna do is we're going to attach these molecules to a Co enzyme with the most boring name on the planet.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called co enzyme a. Andrew Ippolito: that's co a, and so this collectively this molecule here with an acidic acid attached to a Co enzyme that acidic gas that is now technically a functional group, and so we can call this.\nAndrew Ippolito: A seagull co a. Andrew Ippolito: mouse with this molecule is.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we make tool molecules of a pseudo code here to pirates came in.\nAndrew Ippolito: To acetylcholine leave. Andrew Ippolito: And in the liberation of that energy that dehydrogenase is able to manufacture for each one of those a total of two nadh.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we're trapped more of the energy of glucose now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the product, here we got to any ditches.\nAndrew Ippolito: We got to a seagull co a's and to carbon dioxide's what came in, or the two pirates.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this three molecule this three carbon molecule has a carbon popped off and in that process releases energy and that energy is put into an eth molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: and the resulting product of that is stapled to a Co enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: questions. Andrew Ippolito: Go ahead alexa. Alexa Deprisco: Where did the na de plus come from and where did like the electrons that reduced it come from.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the any so. Andrew Ippolito: Any D plus is everywhere in the cell there's not a lot of it it's an expensive molecule, but I want you to think of it as just floating around.\nAndrew Ippolito: That that's a great question because that that's something, most of us don't really think about where all these things coming from you can think of the cell is filled with this very rich very lush thing called the metabolic pool.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's all these metabolites floating around and end as a metabolite and it's it's a rare one though it's kind of like you're rummaging through your Lego been looking for the one cool piece that takes forever to find.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's why out in the cytoplasm we needed fermentation there's not a lot of this stuff.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Oh that's a great question Tyler how fast these processes occur billions of times a second.\nAndrew Ippolito: crazy fast. Andrew Ippolito: so fast that it, I mean yeah things happen at the molecular level that we would have to slow things down we couldn't film this let's put it that way, instead, what we do to study these things is we use.\nAndrew Ippolito: Lots of it that's one way to do it, and then we can also inhibit processes and then watch what builds up as a result of the inhibition.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah so we're we're we're coming to the table here after decades of other people doing all this work to Paul this apart this this was insanely complicated to figure out right so yeah it's happening by Ruby dehydrogenase enzyme can process millions of molecules a second.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's actually really if you look at the PowerPoint there's this amazing picture of it it's a it's a sphere, within a sphere.\nAndrew Ippolito: That rotates inside. Andrew Ippolito: And so you can think of. Andrew Ippolito: Think of a whole bunch of like a swarm of bees coming in on one side and leaving, on the other side is co it just all at once.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sorry, more questions oh so we alexa the second part of your question, where the electrons coming from Paraguay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right we're ripping it apart so we're taking a pair of electrons from Nairobi and depositing them in nadh and so we're breaking a bond and i'm the carbon dioxide gets liberated, and we still have that to carbon a seal group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the electrons are being ripped out of here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Breaking some right, these are high energy bots right piru it's a high energy molecules so the high energy electrons are going to take the high energy pair of electrons and stick it into an ad.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm gonna grab a proton from the environment and create a bond. Andrew Ippolito: you're still confused.\nAndrew Ippolito: Go ahead pass your follow up question. Alexa Deprisco: So it's broken into like four things i'm because, like a CO2 to have it's going to see you a and then to have it's going to the nh T plus.\nAlexa Deprisco: let's. Andrew Ippolito: see this movie.\nAndrew Ippolito: Better, so we need Kobe here, and then we need an ad.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's your you there. Andrew Ippolito: I think that's everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here I have a slide on this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here we go. Andrew Ippolito: here's here is the pirate oxidation so you start out with a three car molecule you pop off one of the carbons right and your deposit that energy into the nav plus to make the beach, and you bring coins ma in here, and you attach the remaining bits of the molecule to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so think of this pair of energy high energy electrons is being deposited here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the remaining bit here finds its way onto Kelly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so you know there's an enzyme that's mediation all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: yeah Okay, and again we're because we're simplifying things we're not looking at the detailed mechanisms they're still going to be some unaccounted for things like where are the other electrons come from this let's not worry about that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, for everybody, the key to this is, we now have some useful energy deposited into this bucket.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we still have this relatively high energy molecule acetylcholine that we can continue to mine for energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and that carbon dioxide is a guessing that is a byproduct, this is a waste product, and it goes away it diffusers downhill out of the cell small uncharged.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: it's 1215 or 10 minutes to get to the end of this, I want to do it, I wanted to do this, one pass.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's go back here and again we are in the mitochondrial matrix and we have just made in a co co a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some sad. Andrew Ippolito: What we're gonna do is we're going to take that a cto co a we're going to transport it here to the Krebs cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: So now i'm going to give you the simple version of the Krebs cycle, this is probably one of the most famous things that all students have to deal with one time or another in their biology career the Krebs cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll give it to you in the simplest way I can to start with. Andrew Ippolito: So it's a cycle, like the Calvin cycle we're gonna end where we started we're going to start where we end right.\nAndrew Ippolito: We start with this relatively high energy pair of carbons right covertly linked that's your seal group of the co a.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's bound to Kobe here so there's your acetylcholine.\nAndrew Ippolito: And and let's draw this is a blue, so this is a cold molecule one oops to choose 1234 let me think for a minute, for that is our old friend mal eight.\nAndrew Ippolito: Number from the sea for plants. Andrew Ippolito: Know we're going to do a mallet, though, and I here i'm gonna give you i'm going to put him a little down here i'm going to give you the end story here the very last reaction here the 10th reaction is to take malley 1234 and oxidize it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that we can have this name here ready ox low oxalic awake say hello Alex Hello acetate.\nAndrew Ippolito: acetate is the oxidized form of molly molly is the reduced form of bucks Lol.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's the very last step of the Krebs cycle. Andrew Ippolito: we're not talking about products at all when I feel like there's an any beach there we're not going to worry about any of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because here's what we're going to do here's the first part of the Krebs cycle we're going to take this for carbon molecule and this to carbon molecule and we're going to staple them together.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the very first step and we're going to get let's make it orange it's hot but not super hot 123456 so, in other words the super hot molecule touch as a cold molecule and evenly distribute the heat throughout and you get this water molecule that's citric acid or citrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: The eponymous citrate the citric acid cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Great like piru beat and I Rubik acid citrate citric acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then in a series of again it's another 10 chemical reactions we're not going to do the details i'm just going to summarize this ready we're going to go through i'm just going to doodle some circles, or some some arrows like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I just want to get back here. Andrew Ippolito: And in that process we're going to degrade this six carbon molecule to a 12345 carbon molecule plus a cold carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to do that a second time. Andrew Ippolito: 12345 pop up and other CO2.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there it is those are the original two carbons that came in, are now liberated as carbon dioxide So those are the last vestiges of the original glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now we have this relatively warm for carbon molecule we're going to further oxidized down to maui.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we go from a six to a five to a four i've made that a five, this is a 41234 and we're going to take that warm for mount carbon molecule to a cold for carbon molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: So now let's talk about you know we're getting energy out of this right, so where's the energy we're going to get out of this a summary we're going to get.\nAndrew Ippolito: A total out of all this, of three nadh is.\nAndrew Ippolito: one. Andrew Ippolito: F EE D H two. And one ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: In various exit points that we don't have to worry about right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the summary of what comes out. Andrew Ippolito: And of course the byproducts of to carbon dioxide."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Electron Transport Chain","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the electron transport chain, where the high-energy electron carriers (NADH, FADH2) are used to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.","start":"1:02:46","end":"1:06:08","content":"Andrew Ippolito: that's the summary of what comes out. Andrew Ippolito: And of course the byproducts of to carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this this mapping here, this is her acetylcholine.\nAndrew Ippolito: But remember, there are two a cto co is per original glucose molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the Krebs cycle runs twice per glucose molecule just like everything else has been happening twice, and so the the accounting for a single glucose molecule one.\nAndrew Ippolito: glucose molecule yields, a total of six just doubling all that six nadh to.\nAndrew Ippolito: add two. Andrew Ippolito: To ATP. Andrew Ippolito: And then of course the for CO2.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that for CO2 should make sense, because that's the original form carbons that came in.\nAndrew Ippolito: So one thing you should do and you're studying of this is trace the feet of the carbons Where do they get lost you six come in and six have to leave.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll see that two of them get lost during the Peruvian oxidation step and the remaining four get lost in the Krebs cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And then bear with me here's the last the swan song of the entire process we have four minutes left i'm just going to give you the summary of what happens after all this, this is the end game.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if you ever watched your vendors end game after Tony stark dies there's still story that happens, nobody cares about it because Tony stark's to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so. Andrew Ippolito: Would you say. Jordan Russell: I said I beg to differ.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah so there's all the stuff that happens after glucose as long dead.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's think about it, we have number glycol says we made we had those two nadh is right and let's say that or there to F ED teachers.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then in Peruvian oxidation we made to any ditches.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the Krebs cycle, we made six nadh is and to F ED tues.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so what I just track there was all those electron carriers forget the tps we made some ATP to but we're just focusing on these electronic characters.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because here, here we have all these filled energy buckets with nothing to do with them yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this right here, this is where we've trapped, the vast majority of the glucose is free energy, and so we got to do something with it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the very last thing we're gonna do is we're going to take these super duper high energy electron carriers we're gonna dump them into an electron transport chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: So ready here's the outer mitochondrial membrane. Andrew Ippolito: And here are the Chris day.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and I want to draw the Christie simply like this right now just just for this diagram here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what i'm gonna do is i'm going to show you there are, let me draw this really thick."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Conclusion","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito concludes the lecture by highlighting the overall energy production and carbon accounting in glucose metabolism.","start":"1:06:08","end":"1:04:50","content":""},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Introduction to the Lumen of the Mitochondria","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of the lumen of the mitochondria and its role in cellular respiration.

Andrew Ippolito: Or rather, the mechanism of that pumping is driven by protons so this proton concentration that we're building up actually does at least two jobs for our purposes make ATP and also pump Peruvian across the memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that pumping is variable there's not a precise amount of ATP so.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's about 30 at the end of the day, that's the best, most accurate thing we can say.\nAndrew Ippolito: which turns out to be about 29% of the original 686 kilocalories when you do the math there if you do 30 ATP time 7.3 kilocalories per mole."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 1) - Cell Respiration","link":"https://youtu.be/IdxSCLgjqRI?si=L31hD3sZKDsrgDpJ","chunkTitle":"Remaining Questions and Test Preparation","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito addresses remaining questions and provides information about the upcoming test.

Andrew Ippolito: In the complexities of the way the proteins are designed.\nAndrew Ippolito: or. Andrew Ippolito: Cheap.\nAndrew Ippolito: That the electron sucks the proton and and just basically pushes it across with this charge somehow and in that process that's where it's losing its energy that's why the electron goes from a high energy state to low energy state right in the same way if you if you are.\nAndrew Ippolito: running again here i'm sorry here's another football analogy, if you ever seen the movies, you got or the one they practice, they have these big heavy bag things right, and they they run and they charge up a boy that's a broken man I don't know here, trying to make a runner.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's running at it right so he's got some amount of energy and then he slams into that and he moves it and then he stops moving.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right he's given up his energy and transferred to the big bag, I like to think the electron is giving its energy to that proton and making it move across the the memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that that's the best I can do for you and and it's it's not a perfect dancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: But there's probably some truth in there.

Andrew Ippolito: To net and glycol genesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: and two in the Krebs cycle, and this is again this is per glucose molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: And to give you an idea of how inefficient, that is. Andrew Ippolito: Right remember there's 686 kilocalories and a single glucose molecule your 7.3 kilocalories in an ATP molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so you do 7.3 times for you get about 30 i'm just ballpark and i'm not doing decimal points right so there's around this to 700.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that comes out to about 2%. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so you go to the airport with $100 bill you're going to the UK you hand them $100 bill, and they give you two pounds.\nAndrew Ippolito: What where'd my $98 go transaction fees.\nAndrew Ippolito: By the way, that's not the actual exchange rate. Andrew Ippolito: But if it was that'd be terrible right, just like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you add up the amount of ATP is generated through that electron transport chain and they come to us Moses, and the any nadh in the FDA to you get 20 http.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that 20 plus that for that gives you the 32 that's the maximum you're ever going to make that we never actually so think of that in chemistry, you might have heard the phrase maximum theoretical yield.\nAndrew Ippolito: like this is how much we can produce you're never going to make that amount. Andrew Ippolito: right when you do your chemistry so someday you're going to take a quick chemistry class and you're going to read the maximum theoretical yield of the process we're about to do is 17 grams or.\nAndrew Ippolito: Two grams and you're going to do it you're going to get point oh five grams and you're gonna have to calculate how efficient your reactions were answered not buried.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, this is the kind of stuff for the pharmaceutical industry deals with right, you have to optimize your conditions to maximize your product that's what this kind of is right so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when we do that math we get about 30%.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's as good as we're going to get 70% of it gets wasted as heat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so Tyler can you explain how the movement of electrons and provide energy to move proton you know that's a question that i've wrestled with myself and.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is what i've come up with I don't know if this is necessarily the truth of it, so what she asked is, this is a great question, this is something I really thought a lot about so here let's just say that this box represents.\nAndrew Ippolito: The electron transport chain as a whole Okay, I just want you to think about the relationship between.\nAndrew Ippolito: A i'm an electron here oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's an electron. Andrew Ippolito: and\nhere's a proton. Andrew Ippolito: here's a proton they're attracted to each other right negative and positive they like each other, so the way i've always kind of done it in my head.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I don't know if this is right or not, so I don't I don't have the actual answer for you and I don't I don't even know if they have the answer i'm sure somebody somebody right this isn't something you gentlemen read about in textbooks.\nAndrew Ippolito: I like to imagine as the electron moves, let me do a different color as the electron moves.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's talking this, along with it and that something happens. Andrew Ippolito: In the complexities of the way the proteins are designed.\nAndrew Ippolito: or. Andrew Ippolito: Cheap.\nAndrew Ippolito: That the electron sucks the proton and and just basically pushes it across with this charge somehow and in that process that's where it's losing its energy that's why the electron goes from a high energy state to low energy state right in the same way if you if you are.\nAndrew Ippolito: running again here i'm sorry here's another football analogy, if you ever seen the movies, you got or the one they practice, they have these big heavy bag things right, and they they run and they charge up a boy that's a broken man I don't know here, trying to make a runner.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's running at it right so he's got some amount of energy and then he slams into that and he moves it and then he stops moving.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right he's given up his energy and transferred to the big bag, I like to think the electron is giving its energy to that proton and making it move across the the memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that that's the best I can do for you and and it's it's not a perfect dancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: But there's probably some truth in there. Andrew Ippolito: OK, so the point is is that when when we're done with it alright, the electron is now in this this this low state and that's when oxygens waiting in the wings to grab it and that's what we've generated the water with.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because right there's protons everywhere so just grabbed one of them, because there's you know they're all over the place, so the oxygen plus the protons electrons that gives us the water back and that's the very, very, very last act in cell respiration.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's look at the question in what reactions of cell respiration and fermentation to substrate phosphorylation or why already gave you the answer right we talked about so what's the answer anybody.\nD. Andrew Ippolito: anybody else agree.\nAndrew Ippolito: raise your hand. Andrew Ippolito: raise your hand if you don't like it, but you're not sure why.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay Alexis, what do you think. Alexis Micewski: hey. Alexis Micewski: Okay.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 2) - Cell Respiration and Fermentation","link":"https://youtu.be/OQHUmM0ZF2Y?si=zAX0e97TWbaCqsj3","chunkTitle":"Glycolysis and Fermentation","chunkSummary":"Professor Campbell explains the process of glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm and breaks down glucose into pyruvate.

Andrew Ippolito: what's the citric acid cycle what's another word for the citric acid cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, so if you go back to my scribble scrabble by deleted. Andrew Ippolito: me see can I undo that okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Great We talked here is my little doodle right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are two places in cell respiration and fermentation that give us substrate phosphorylation the most common when we think about the causes, which is what your brain popped out, but we also have to remember that the Krebs cycle gives us one to really to one person.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, if you look at the diagrams in the book or my notes the Krebs cycle is this the cycle right it looks like you'll always see it and drawn in this circle like this the pseudo code comes in and then some diagrams I like how they do this on the bottom of it you'll see this rather.\nAndrew Ippolito: See http. http.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it turns out the Krebs cycle actually makes the GDP, and then the GDP is most often converted to an ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your book actually shows you the last step of them i'm never going to ask you about that we'll talk about GT people in your chapter 11 all GDP is is another is another nucleotide triphosphate it has more energy to it at ATP is the dollar bill GDP is like a $50.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we use it to do, big thing and so it's uncommon to use it in most metabolism your protein so G proteins G and the G protein is for this thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, so this is through and somatic reactions here in the Krebs cycle so there's two place so that's why the answer is you're correct it the answer here is D.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so the next question here which of the summary statements below describes the results of the following reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: So look at that reaction carefully what is that. Andrew Ippolito: Give me one word or one phrase one word or phrase to describe that reaction.\ntwo words.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you guys see it. April Neeld: See what's gonna be the answer is that, just like helping us get to the answer.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah no i'm asking you to give me the name it's not in the answers others it's not on the screen at all i'm asking you to pull it out of your brain.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is me trying to give you guys some practice for your recall.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the first. Andrew Ippolito: respiration Thank you. Andrew Ippolito: That is cellular respiration so raisa go in the opposite direction and that's so that's photosynthesis right if you if you go from the right to the left, if you read it, the opposite yes Okay, so this reaction is it's chapters nine and 10 basically.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so what's the first molecule.\nTaylor Campbell: And glucose. Taylor Campbell: Good. Andrew Ippolito: See you six 812 oh six. Andrew Ippolito: You might have had that burned your head when you're a kid see six 812 oh six.\nAndrew Ippolito: A technique is not even glucose right. Andrew Ippolito: What is it what's the best you can say with what's on the screen there what's the best way you can use to describe that molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, again April. April Neeld: I said organic compound. Andrew Ippolito: Okay that's the I like this yeah so that's.\nApril Neeld: We. Andrew Ippolito: So we can get a little more accurate. Andrew Ippolito: it's it's an organic compound go ahead Taylor. Taylor Campbell: mono saccharine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's a mono saccharine. Taylor Campbell: hydrate we.\nAndrew Ippolito: said that. Zachary Lucas: exists so. Andrew Ippolito: Excellent that's all I was looking for.\nAndrew Ippolito: Texas sugar. Andrew Ippolito: Right it's a six got six carbons in it and it's a sugar what makes it a sugar what's the definition of a carbohydrate again.\nAndrew Ippolito: What makes that a sugar instead of an alcohol, for example.\nTaylor Campbell: Carbon and oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: So alcohol is also have carbon and.\nApril Neeld: oxygen Is it the ratio. April Neeld: Yes, yeah. April Neeld: it's the specific ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: That what's the magic ratio Do you remember it. April Neeld: isn't a one to one.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is exactly what I wanted you to watch and if you have trouble remembering that just think of water h2o then stick a carbon on it carbo hydrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and the next molecule and while the others are all old friends, we don't need to name these guys okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: What are the other two die. Andrew Ippolito: die diatonic elements.\nTaylor Campbell: h2o water. Andrew Ippolito: h2o good hydrogen and.\nTaylor Campbell: who's the third oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: Nitrogen. Andrew Ippolito: Good okay hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen Those are our three diatonic elements What that means is, we only find them in nature, together there's H2 and to note two.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can even put them in order for single double triple bonds hydrogen got one double bond oxygen got a double bond Nigerians got in trouble bump.\nGood. Andrew Ippolito: And then you see where it says, plus energy what's the most common form of that energy at the end of mothers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh. Andrew Ippolito: You guys got me yes that's actually better than the answer. April Neeld: I was thinking. Andrew Ippolito: Like how fast, you said let's do a heat yeah 70% he was so so what's what's the most common molecule will find that energy and.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just a really good exercise things that I think are very obvious because i've been doing this for so many years i'm realizing very quickly or not super obvious as you're learning this, though, so this is really.\nJordan Russell: This is a helpful exercise for me to. Andrew Ippolito: What form is that energy in.\nAlexis Micewski: A teepee. Excellent. Alexis Micewski: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Well, why wouldn't you say nadh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, because if you think about it, when you add everything up right you got all those nadh is in the Krebs cycle yeah like six of them all those any beaches and pirate oxidation you got the any vhs and like like causes was a why why isn't the answer to that nadh.\nAngela Harbeck: doesn't nadh doesn't it like slow down stuff like I know it's an energy but doesn't like make things break down slower, I remember reading about that in the textbook.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay okay yeah so and. Andrew Ippolito: So the actual answer i'm like thinking about is.\nAndrew Ippolito: We use the nadh to. Andrew Ippolito: Go ahead tell her. Taylor Campbell: I was gonna say, like the nadh is part of like the site, but to energize the cycle it's not the final outcome good.\nTaylor Campbell: it's. Andrew Ippolito: an intermediate basically. Andrew Ippolito: Excellent right, so we, what do we do with the energy in the nadh again what what's the main job of that in console respiration.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody. Angela Harbeck: was what I just said about how like it slows it down.\nAngela Harbeck: or they get shut down so it's not so like. Angela Harbeck: Fast I don't know.\nAndrew Ippolito: anybody else. Andrew Ippolito: what's the main job of any beach.\nAndrew Ippolito: F ED to.\nAlexis Micewski: Transfer electrons good to. Or what.\nAlexis Micewski: The electron transport chain excellent. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and then, of course, then we do the chaos Moses, and we do the ATP synthesis and that's where the energy ends up in the ATP all right good all right so which statement below best describes the results of the reaction.\nApril Neeld: So. Andrew Ippolito: Would you say. He. Andrew Ippolito: Did you see he I don't think you said yeah but I heard.\nApril Neeld: He isn't a dog. Andrew Ippolito: The dog okay. Andrew Ippolito: So i'm going to look so let's go through let's go through a through D here oh two is oxidized.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's next so here Alexis look at that, so you got on what on the left side of the equation you guys see you six years old, oh six and on and on the right hand side you got CO2 and h2o so which of those two substrates on on the left, would we say is oxidized.\nAlexis Micewski: that's. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: Right we're stealing so one way to simply think about this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is track oh you can't see that Canyon I have to use like white here how long track.\nAndrew Ippolito: here. Andrew Ippolito: There we go okay track the hydrogens.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the simple way to the shortcut thinking in all this is look at the flow of the hydrogens because they come along with the electrons right so basically what we're doing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is we're taking those electrons and depositing them and oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know very long convoluted maze of interactions Okay, so you would say oxygen is reduced, and you would say glucose is oxidized.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 2) - Cell Respiration and Fermentation","link":"https://youtu.be/OQHUmM0ZF2Y?si=zAX0e97TWbaCqsj3","chunkTitle":"The Krebs Cycle","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito dives into the details of the Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle.

Andrew Ippolito: Not carbon dioxide yeah so you are correct April.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right CO2 i'm thinking in the reverse of this so when races said that photosynthesis right in photosynthesis when we go this way we're saying we reduce carbon dioxide to glucose and we oxidize water to oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so. Andrew Ippolito: The redux flow is simply reversed.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you step back and you can admire this and appreciate it beautiful story here the of the way energy on earth is working here.\nAndrew Ippolito: From the sun flowing down it's a whole series of redux.\nAndrew Ippolito: right number three which of the following let's let's go a little faster and I, I do have this will teach you some new material for the test which of the following statements about any D plus is true.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are read these out loud, so any D plus is reduced to nadh during like calluses pirated oxidation and the citric acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: be any D plus has more chemical energy than nadh C and D plus can donate electrons for use and oxidative phosphorylation D and the absence of any D plus like causes can still function or eat is generally has a positive outlook on things.\nAndrew Ippolito: A lot of my jokes when I read them a semester later aren't nearly as funny as I thought they were.\nAndrew Ippolito: To what's going on here what's the answer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which one of these statements is true.\nAndrew Ippolito: hey I like that answer anybody else like a. Zachary Lucas: Well, he likes it I guess i'll.\nsure. Andrew Ippolito: Why why Why is a be wrong.\nTaylor Campbell: And isn't it that opposite good. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so one thing I want you all to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is think about that redux cycle right, so we so the book causes the energy cycle, but, more generally, you have a redux cycle, you have what we talked about earlier, you have a molecule that gets electrons and then it loses them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, you see how I drew that there, so this thing here versus this thing here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this date what's the state called is that that oxidize reduce deep.\nAngela Harbeck: reduces getting added to it. So this is oxidized.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so any D plus. Andrew Ippolito: An ad ah.\nAndrew Ippolito: alright. Andrew Ippolito: These molecules have reduced forums and they have oxidized forms the reduced form is the one that has the energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's not always the case. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, if you look at water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember for policies right when water loses its electrons and guess oxidized oxygen is actually the higher energy state.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because waters electron number photo system to steals those right remember photo system to grab the electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it oxidizes it, but those are low energy electrons right water is very stable right we we we drink water to keep her body's going, but we can't extract the energy from him we use water put fires out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so don't always associate having the electrons with being more energetic all right, and the best example, though, is at the end of the electron transport chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: When oxygen is sitting there.\nAndrew Ippolito: and generates that water right these electrons are low in energy, because they just got used up pumping all those protons right there cold that's still a reduction, you would still say oxygen is reduced to water it's just.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's not like any deal right so just make sure you can distinguish don't associate reduction with high energy absolutely.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just associated with a transfer of electrons we in our conversations and learning about these pathways are talking about a pair of high energy electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: To be used for work okay. Andrew Ippolito: But just make sure in the back your mind someday you're going to be dealing with this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or, or when you're thinking through this stuff you're like wait well how is water getting electrons how is water higher energy you're thinking about it wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's just getting electrons those could be low energy electrons it can be high energy electrons okay it's still reduction, because I got electrons.\nJulia Lakchin: Something that helps me memorize reduction and oxidation is Leo Ger so loose.\nJulia Lakchin: On Leo girl so electron oxidized gain electron reduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Give me the acronym again. Julia Lakchin: Leo Elio.\nJulia Lakchin: And gar je er. Andrew Ippolito: Oh okay so let's think the oil rig I learned from another student long ago oil rig is oxidation is last reduction.\nJulia Lakchin: Is game. Andrew Ippolito: Leo girl. Andrew Ippolito: German guy named Leo.\nAndrew Ippolito: Loss electron oxidation oxidation is loss that's good this is going to go on somebody screams done and then everybody's gonna be confused.\nAndrew Ippolito: So these are just for those of you who are confused the these are just ways of memorizing right oxidation is lost reduction is game that's oil rig and then the ogre as Julia said is loss of electrons is oxidation gaining electrons is reduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Choose your poison.\nAndrew Ippolito: To maybe when you start taking your test, the first thing you do is you write down one of these at the top of your tests are right on your scratch paper.\nYou can refer to it if you need to. Andrew Ippolito: Remember, you can use scrap paper in and tests and you can you know, as you can do a data dump if you want, you can just start scribbling on your scrap paper, if you want, you know you just can't bring scrap paper that has previous notes on the test.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's cheating. Andrew Ippolito: But it's not cheating, if you have something in your head and you want to write it down on a piece of paper be filled after you start taking the test.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's talk about D now, this will talk about fermentation here.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the absence of any D plus like causes can still function.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right remember think of any be as a bucket and it's either full or empty.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right see the reduced processed and it's reduced the you know the good state.\nAndrew Ippolito: It can't get any more electrons right. Andrew Ippolito: it's already got them, and so, if the cell is filled with any dh or let's say at a better way if all of the any D in the cell is in its reduced state let's say you have a billion molecules of an end and all billion of those molecules is in the nadh for.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then glucose comes into the cell. Andrew Ippolito: That cell will not be able to continue like houses, because it doesn't have the reactive any D plus to do its job in that process, and so the whole system, come to a halt.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the absence of oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: Like calluses products remember don't enter into the mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: They just linger in the cytoplasm. Andrew Ippolito: So, if you think about like causes you think about the products of it, you got your those ATP the four ATP but the to net right yeah some ATP generated, we have some movie.\nAndrew Ippolito: We got this any D. Andrew Ippolito: And the absence of oxygen none of those things does anything useful beyond that the piracy is just lingering because we can't get into the mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: The nadh can't get into the mitochondria to donate electrons to the electron transport chain right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what does it do it just languishes and the cytoplasm, and so what fermentation does is it looks so let's anthropomorphised sizes, like our office analogy, so any dh and Peruvian are just hanging around.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: They see more glucose coming into the cell and pervy it looks at any deviation nadh looks at pirate movie and they're like well how, how are we going to handle the situation not pyros like i'm fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can go do something else in some synthesis pathway in any dh is like holding a glowing hot potato and he's in pain he's like you know you know what.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm just going to give this to you and pirates like I can't handle that and then each like I don't care and just dump it on the pyro pyro dies blows up and any beach is now any of you, plus and it can go back and handle some organic causes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, a new pirate pops up. Andrew Ippolito: hey, what can I do. Andrew Ippolito: You can die and then any beach kills him to and that's to keep doing that.\nAndrew Ippolito: The old analogy, I use was. Andrew Ippolito: By remembering all the horror movies, think of there's a horror movie pirates running down the corridor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he's being chased by a monster the bug you guys have read about the cabal get that's the new jk Rowling book.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're reading this in my that's after the Harry Potter Harry Potter we're now we make a bug i'm not a huge fan of it so far, but there's this monster called the bug.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so piru beats being chased by the bog down the corner and he gets to the end of the quarter and there's a locked door.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he fumbling for his keys. Andrew Ippolito: And the only two outcomes to this right he's either going to get his key out and he's gonna open lock in time.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's going to get through the door and survive only to go through the meat grinder of pi robot oxidation really that's his feet in there or he's going to get trapped in the cytoplasm and the monster is going to get them and that monsters and a beach.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So that's the cost of the fermentation to job of fermentation is to make any dh empty again so that it can go back and get good causes to keep doing and stuff so we can keep generating so many tp it's not much, but it's something.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: raise your hand me sounds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, to have you raise your hand that made no sense. Andrew Ippolito: To see hands are Tyler okay go ahead and do the entire you ask me questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Regina diagram. Taylor Campbell: know I guess it it kind of makes sense I don't know I just sometimes like.\nTaylor Campbell: The different preferences like just like. Andrew Ippolito: Oh that's yeah that's fine I mean yeah yeah I do I kind of get what you're saying it's just.\nTaylor Campbell: Sometimes I get lost in the story. Andrew Ippolito: that's fair.\nhere's pirate. Andrew Ippolito: And do notice that kind of your sentiment to yeah all right here's my review right that's the product of the causes are the like hospitality.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to further ado stuff to him right and then mitochondria if we can get there right, and so, in order to get there in order to get past that double membrane we got to pump it in order to get that pump going, we need some protons.\nAndrew Ippolito: In order to get those protons and then we need an oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so all that downstream stuff so you can just summarize everything in the presence of oxygen pair of it goes into America.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in the absence of oxygen ready here's the logic without oxygen the electron transport chain can't do its job.\nAndrew Ippolito: If the electron transport chain can't do its job, the protons don't get pumped it the protons don't get pumped we don't have a chemical gradient to do work with if we can't do work we can't get Peruvian.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 2) - Cell Respiration and Fermentation","link":"https://youtu.be/OQHUmM0ZF2Y?si=zAX0e97TWbaCqsj3","chunkTitle":"Oxidative Phosphorylation and Electron Transport Chain","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place in the mitochondria and involves the electron transport chain.

Andrew Ippolito: there's a pump here, driven by protons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, in order to get the proton pump working, you need oxygen, on the other side and the absence of oxygen pie ravi stays here in the cytoplasm.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now, meanwhile here's your nav plus being reduced to your nadh and that pathway.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, in the presence of oxygen and he gets in here, this is all black box just don't worry about what's going on here just understand that sometimes it comes in, as nadh and other times it comes in here is F ED and that only comes in, in the presence of oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay i'm sorry i'm not going to go through the molecular mechanism I don't fully understand that myself I don't think we fully understand this.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think, just in general, this is one of those things that we're still learning about the excruciating details of this okay so.\nAndrew Ippolito: And adh, this is the molecule it's got those heavy duty high energy electrons that we want to do some work with to make some ATP we can't do that work if we don't have oxygen present.\nAndrew Ippolito: because all that work takes place in the mitochondria and we can't get there, so what do we do, we still need this to allow the glide calluses to continue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Without that any D Plus we can't do like houses without costs we can't make ATP right remember in the absence of oxygen we can still there are some things that can still survive right anaerobic bacteria and and faculty native Arabs, the idea of a organism that can live with or without.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like yeast. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so what we're going to do is this we're going to dump that energy and approve it, so that we can go and pick up some more energy to make some more ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Rather, so that we can keep their costs going right there there's just a loop there, instead, and so what happens as a consequence of this is driven by enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are it's not any peaches and just like throwing his energy up, I really there's enzymatic reactions there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that's fermentation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, and there have been different mechanisms that have evolved over time there's dozens of them there's only two that your book talks about there's alcohol fermentation.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can also just call that ethanol fermentation you can abbreviate ethanol E to each ethanol fermentation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then there's also. Andrew Ippolito: lactic acid fermentation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, which one you do depends on what your genes tell. Andrew Ippolito: You can't swap them.\nAndrew Ippolito: We as mammals go through lactic acid fermentation.\nAndrew Ippolito: If we went through alcohol fermentation that would not be. Andrew Ippolito: Very good for our survival you start running when you get tired you get drunk.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's not good, the animals will eat you. Andrew Ippolito: that's why I didn't have all right, you may be today, some people might like that wow you really are committed to your exercise regime, I can quit whenever I want.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can. Andrew Ippolito: Okay you're not going to be able to survive if your body is generating a toxin that affects your neuro chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: makes you clumsy so Instead, what we do is we do left to guess from indeed and what happens is that that to guess it builds up and our muscles and then, when so we're in a state called oxygen debt.\nAndrew Ippolito: right when you run so hard for so long that you start burning your food faster than you can bring the oxygen in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's that's that's a that's a very dangerous state to be in you will eventually collapse you can't keep going if you've ever watched world class athletes and the Olympics and they're long distance running when they get over that finish line.\nAndrew Ippolito: They just fall over. Andrew Ippolito: right they have pushed themselves to the limits of modern humans know, as I say, modern humans.\nAndrew Ippolito: were still softies even the best olympiads if you go back 250,000 years everybody was received bold.\nAndrew Ippolito: know that the average human back then can run you know 26 miles without breaking a sweat we were superhuman.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah we didn't live very long, to be fair, know protozoa.us bacteria got us, but we could run we we are that's what we about to do we had to our life depended on it, whether we were running away from getting eaten or other people or running at our food to kill it to eat it.\nAndrew Ippolito: We ran and ran and ran ran ran. Andrew Ippolito: yeah it's kind of amazing when you learn about this stuff so anyway lactic acid then gets pumped to your liver your liver converts it backed up by Ruby you know by Ruby goes through your normal once you start breathing and you get oxygen back.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to pay off that debt, eventually, and the way we do that is by spending a lot of energy converting that laughter yes back to pirate movie in the liver and then we convert that back, we do standard South respiration.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right let's do the rest of these quick now when I get to the PowerPoint here, I want to take a break we'll take a break in glass houses for each molecule of glucose oxidize topiramate ah, this is a great.\nAndrew Ippolito: question, this is the you know the summary level information vm do your accounting see what you got so English houses for each molecule glucose oxidized a pirate we.\nAndrew Ippolito: Only got two molecules B2B are used to mark because you're producing to are used for produced for are used to are produced.\nAndrew Ippolito: Two are used six are produced or every for each molecule glucose oxidizing angel get this week.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a lot of angels. Taylor Campbell: how's it going thanks.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's the answer.\nOkay April has altered. Be bravo.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody agree raise your hand if you agree with April. Andrew Ippolito: raise your hand you disagree.\nAndrew Ippolito: With her against her. Andrew Ippolito: Now all right, how many of you aren't sure.\nTaylor Campbell: See but. Zachary Lucas: I guess I have it backwards we're talking about like the net production or ATP yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: So yeah you had it backwards so right where we're using to so. Andrew Ippolito: The thing you have to study is.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's three phases of like causes there's the first phase, the energy investment phase that's when we use to ATP to get the ball rolling, we fast for later it's kind of racism involved.\nAndrew Ippolito: That does two things that traps, the glucose in the cell and it bends it puts it in an unstable situation where it's more likely to fall apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the energy investment phase, the second phase of cleavage fee is we break it in half, now we got our two molecules of GDP, just like photosynthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then through another series of pathways the energy liberation phase, or the payoff is when we meet for https and to any deeds me so we make, for we used to we net that's why we say it generates two.\nTaylor Campbell: Okay, I think that's where I was confused so don't we get to at the end, but Okay, you see.\nTaylor Campbell: Yes. Andrew Ippolito: Why, you know what color. Andrew Ippolito: Both of those statements and into but only one of those statements, is what actually happens.\nTaylor Campbell: right because we're just like that's like kind of more behind the scenes like there's two. Taylor Campbell: yeah being used and then there's two being could do.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so say it this way, we used. Andrew Ippolito: To we make for. Andrew Ippolito: yeah that's the best way to think of it.\nTaylor Campbell: But then we need to more. say again. Taylor Campbell: Right from the four don't we used to.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah. Andrew Ippolito: yeah we make, for we used to but but say it in that order, we use to to make for because that's the first, the first step of all this is using some ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so if you put it in order in your head to by saying that you asked that also helps you understand the overall pathway better to.\nAndrew Ippolito: We use to to make for. Andrew Ippolito: All right number five.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which electron carrier carriers functions in the citric acid it's like any D plus only nadh and F ED to the electron transport chain ATP ATP.\nDanuta Despagne: Be. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: So this was this is easiest going to get so if this if the answer to five didn't jump out at you that's just a matter of just going through the motions and putting it into your head right so like Level one is just mapping it all out.\nAndrew Ippolito: and making sure that you can recall that on a blank piece of paper that's what I would do if I was studying stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay number six if glucose is the soul energy source, what fraction of the carbon dioxide exhaled by animals is generated only by the reactions involved in oxidation of pervy to acetylcholine, this is a tricky one that's probably the hardest question on the quiz see what you got.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll give you a minute to think about this one.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the answer, what do you think I see it, somebody thinks hey.\nAndrew Ippolito: anybody else agree with a. Andrew Ippolito: dinner think say okay tell her think say likes this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's going on here where so think of the six items that come in the six carbons right six carbons and they all eventually leave seo to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, if you remember the six carbons gets broken down into two three carbons right and they go into the matrix.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then that first step which we're talking about here, we take that pirate beat and we oxidize it and one of the things we do is we pop off a carbon so to leave out of the original six to six reduced to one third So the answer is good job done here.\nAndrew Ippolito: What are the other two thirds last.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody.\nTaylor Campbell: say that the other two, three or lost. Andrew Ippolito: The other two third yeah where are the other two thirds.\nTaylor Campbell: Of carbons last. Andrew Ippolito: word is glucose got to meet his feet.\nZachary Lucas: Good. Andrew Ippolito: All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: number seven which statement is true about the electron transport chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: A it's driven by ATP hydrolysis, be it includes a series of hydrolysis reactions associated with mitochondrial membranes see it consists of a series of redux reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: d it occurs in the cytoplasm of both pro chaotic and eukaryotic cells are he do you know what the chain of command is it's the chain I beat you with if you don't know what the chain of command is.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a quote from firefly.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 2) - Cell Respiration and Fermentation","link":"https://youtu.be/OQHUmM0ZF2Y?si=zAX0e97TWbaCqsj3","chunkTitle":"Summary and Review","chunkSummary":"Professor Campbell and Professor Ippolito summarize the key points discussed in the lecture, including the different stages of cellular respiration and their significance.

Andrew Ippolito: Nice job title casus how many of you had that in your head yeah just one i'm you to just April on Alexis how many of you had it, how many of you were at least did a pop in your head as a possibility.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it so that what I wanted to do there was a while you start believing in yourself, you were right you like casus was sitting there being chewed on as an idea your brain was in the right place.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay start believing in yourself number eight. Andrew Ippolito: A person on a strict diet and exercise regime lost seven kilograms but I don't have no idea how much that is that's about 15 pounds of body, fat and just two weeks, what is the most likely way the last fat left a body.\nAndrew Ippolito: hey it was released as carbon dioxide and water, be it was converted to heat and then released see it was converted to ATP which was much less than fat D, it was eliminated from the body is feces or he they chop their own arm off.\nAndrew Ippolito: That goes back to a really old stupid joke or her when I was a kid but what's the fastest way to lose 10 pounds type your arm on.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, you have a question mark after that be.\nAndrew Ippolito: To be or not be.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a really profound question, if you think about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: hey let's let's let logic and way through this ready so you've got these items in your body right that's what makes you way, something you got atoms in your body, and when you lose mass.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are you losing energy or you're losing matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right yeah well I first saw this question. Andrew Ippolito: It kind of blew my oh go ahead, see so.\nApril Neeld: So my thinking is I mean most of the energy that has lost their heat, but then I was also flip flopping between A and B, because I know that you're like.\nApril Neeld: When you do metabolism like work with people see how they process, food and how their metabolisms work you count how much see CO2 is released the breath, so I mean that's also like what I was thinking, I was just flip flopping.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah and actually what when we all think about it, we immediately think about burning fat, we talked about sweating we think about sitting in a sauna whatever we we think about shutting me, but if you think about like really think about it, the whole.\nAndrew Ippolito: mechanism of why the heats being generated is because we're breaking stuff down and converting it into carbon dioxide and water, it leaves your body, through your mouth.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when I have really when you have that fight you're like every time you take a breath, you lose a little weight.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's just just breathe it off. Andrew Ippolito: But that's really that's what you're doing you're you're you're melting away and it's just evaporating into the space around you, and then the plants take it make it fat.\nAndrew Ippolito: They make leaves. Andrew Ippolito: yeah it's so it's a it's not eliminate from your body is feces either that's the food comes in the food goes out right food comes in the food goes out that's that's the waist to actually lose the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mass right because they eat food, and yet they still last week right because more is leaving and coming in all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right number nine we're almost done here which of the following metabolic processes normally occurs, regardless of whether or not oxygen is present citric acid cycle like houses lactate fermentation oxidative phosphorylation are complaining.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'd see.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, it goes up in the absence of oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: I put complaining is always there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Shall we came into my office yesterday, the end of the day, he's like dad can I play, can I play video games no you can't play video games buddy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Can I play, can I play the like no you can't everything want to do it on screens my goal is it he's like I don't know what to do, i'm bored.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like that means you're smart being bored as a sign of intelligence buddy I go people are just sat on the couch staring at space right, we all need to do that a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: I asked them what are you thinking about when you're bored. Andrew Ippolito: can be seven he really cannot take music I think about being bored.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay So what can we do what's the answer here, I see I don't see any answer upon import or maybe I do denuded to do is is your answer there for this.\nyeah so I thought. Zachary Lucas: This is just the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is it just what. Zachary Lucas: Of these. Zachary Lucas: Be yeah yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good Why is he not the right answer.\nZachary Lucas: depends on know attitude prison. Andrew Ippolito: Good that only happens to.\nAndrew Ippolito: The others only happen in the presence of us like causes is a constant.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's always happening. Andrew Ippolito: All right, good and the last question here which of the following statements describes a primary function.\nAndrew Ippolito: of both alcohol fermentation lactic acid dramatic reduction of any D plus to nadh reduction of if he did, if he needs to oxidation of nadh to any D plus hydrolysis of ATP ATP plus inorganic phosphate or a successful Mongolian invasions.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's got.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, I see Tyler thinks she's got it anybody else have a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So see.\nAndrew Ippolito: anybody think a.\nAndrew Ippolito: b. Andrew Ippolito: C.\nAndrew Ippolito: D. Andrew Ippolito: First yeah you know what A and C are very easy to swap around right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the answer is see good job. Andrew Ippolito: Right, we want to get another way of saying this is the regeneration of any D plus right if you memorize that without understanding, you would have missed this question.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so understand that we need to oxidize steal the electrons away from an ad.\nAndrew Ippolito: or good so that would have been so go ahead grade yourself, you know, based on the answers you think you had think of how you would have done on that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then i'll give that whatever you want now just kidding Oh, you can. Andrew Ippolito: Put a 10 down, I totally got those.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but really what I like to do when we do this, that the goal of doing this is to help improve your experience and critical thinking.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right I can't teach you how to critically think nobody can teach you how to critically think, and so what I can do is.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like think of solving amaze right think of the skill, you would need to solve a maze I can't teach you how to solve a me, but I can walk you through how I solved mazes and show you a couple of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you'll get the tips and tricks and maybe you'll be able to solve these better that's The point of this that's one point The second point is, I want you to build your self confidence.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, I want you that you have that internal dialogue going on, when you're trying to answer these questions. Andrew Ippolito: And more often than that you probably got them right, but you didn't really feel confident about that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now the one thing I want to make sure that you do on the test is I want you to be paid very careful attention to those common mistakes you traditionally make swapping things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh oxidize instead of reduce up instead of down left instead of right always instead of never make sure that when you get to a question where you're asked to find the truth damon or the false demon that you don't pick the opposite.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so stop dual quality controlling yourself and make sure that when you pick the right answer that you think is the right answer.\nAndrew Ippolito: double check it with that question in mind is this which the phone is a false statement, you see, is then asked this question yourself is see a false statement like repeated in your head like that okay don't.\nAndrew Ippolito: lose points on the easy stuff. Andrew Ippolito: that's the difference between the a and the B student or the being the C student, at the same.\nTime. Andrew Ippolito: The careless mistakes all right. Andrew Ippolito: All right, what i'm going to do now, I know where i'm kind of free from that that that that's a different kind of thinking right that's that's way more intensive than passively looking and thinking about lecturing you know it's all makes sense it all makes sense this is like.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 10 (Part 2) - Cell Respiration and Fermentation","link":"https://youtu.be/OQHUmM0ZF2Y?si=zAX0e97TWbaCqsj3","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Pseudo Code","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of pseudo code and its role in computer programming.","start":"1:16:49","end":"1:17:06","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Because this is co a we call this.\nAndrew Ippolito: The pseudo code.

Andrew Ippolito: The default state of a cell, therefore, is to not grow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you think about it, that makes sense right, otherwise we have cancer everywhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the most common way we tell cells to grow is by giving them a signal that signals we call that a mighty.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and we call that my energetic stimulation or might agenda growth.\nAndrew Ippolito: For cells that are far far away from each other, think of your brain and your big toe.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, as far as you can get in your body and still be in your body right that distance communication that's called endocrine signaling.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's the eponymous form of signaling that we refer to, when we talk about the endocrine system.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your body has an endocrine system it's one of our body systems that we don't normally think about and consider we think about our skeletal system in our muscular system in our cardiovascular system in our.\nAndrew Ippolito: nervous system, we don't usually say endocrine system because it's not structural it's functional you don't see your endocrine system it's scattered throughout your body, and these various.\nAndrew Ippolito: glands.

Andrew Ippolito: To that so so that that's a really good question um i'm going to give you this really gives you this quickly it's important to know going through life I learned what i'm about to tell you from a chief of police a couple years ago.\nAndrew Ippolito: They call it, I think, was it 80 8020 rule.\nAndrew Ippolito: 84 8020 rule so basically. Andrew Ippolito: 80% of people in a crisis situation like active shooter or earthquake something traumatic 80% of people will do what you just said they'll freeze up.\nAndrew Ippolito: They might fall into a fetal position would you say. Andrew Ippolito: Would you say April.\nApril Neeld: i'm just I didn't realize, I was on but yeah I was like wait why. Andrew Ippolito: What so it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a stress response it's it's the deer in headlights it's we lock up out of fear it's it's a I think honestly if it's on spit balling here it's probably.\nAndrew Ippolito: Going into shock. Andrew Ippolito: Okay shock is something our bodies do when something.\nAndrew Ippolito: epic happens to it like severe sudden blood loss you get your arm chopped off and blood gushing your body goes in shock as a survival technique.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, and so a lot of people freeze up. Andrew Ippolito: About so I began, based on what I was told by this chief of police I don't take this with a grain of salt this isn't like something that I have researched with psychology journals and stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Most people freeze up and then there's there's two other groups of people another group of people will not freeze up.\nAndrew Ippolito: They won't take the lead, or initiative, but they will listen to things that people tell them to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: You go over there jump over there to hide behind that thing and they'll just do that don't call 911 they'll do that and then there's a 10% of people who will take charge.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they something go into this calm relaxed hyper focus date they look at the situation they do their best to try to you know, to think they see what's going on and they they're the leaders of those traumatic situations.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the human population is divided up into those roughly three categories of people there are the ones that take charge the ones that listened and can take orders from the ones that take charge than everybody else."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11 - Cell Communication (Ch.11.1-.3) and The Cell Cycle (Ch. 12)","link":"https://youtu.be/9kNHcRALZmA?si=WeYiy58o75dZA-LA","chunkTitle":"Signal Transduction Pathways","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the concept of signal transduction pathways, where a primary messenger binds to a receptor on the cell surface, leading to a cascade of kinase activations.

Andrew Ippolito: Right and it's probably triggered it's probably triggered in the same pathways and from the endocrine system that the fight or flight instinct is right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, everybody has fight or flight, not everybody you want always lock up, it depends on how traumatic, the situation is, I imagine right, I mean if you're like I have a test tomorrow that you didn't study for you're not going to fall into a fetal position.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're going to go into a fight or flight instinct you're going to have a surge of adrenaline we've all had that kind of panic attack. Andrew Ippolito: That right there is when the nervous system is connected to the endocrine system right because because think about it, after that there's no way of coming down from it instantly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the nerve turns it on, but what turns it off is the diffusion of those hormones, which takes 20 minutes or so that's why you feel like crap afterwards and you can't just come right back from it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so. So that. Andrew Ippolito: it's like what. Alexa Deprisco: Is that like positive feedback like.\nAndrew Ippolito: A which one yeah yeah the first one yeah yeah so so it'll it'll dramatically increase stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's probably a positive feedback loop in the beginning of that somewhere I can't pinpoint it no so instead it's more it's more of a.\nAndrew Ippolito: What we're gonna I mean really in the nervous system, you have stimulus, you have a factor and you i'm sorry, you have an affront.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, like the signal comes in, then you process it and think about it, and then you return an effective response, so the after and pathway, the processing and the effort pathway.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's the response it's not necessarily there's the feedback loop happens like when you shiver right you get cold you shiver shivering drops it increase the temperature that takes the same stimulus away that's a negative feedback loop.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, so the endocrine system has a whole bunch of opposing hormones that give us negative feedback loops like insulin versus glucagon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your blood sugar goes up insulin kicks in takes the sugar out and then insulin goes away so there's there's feedback loops in all of this.\nAndrew Ippolito: The fight or flight instinct that's that's the reason why I brought that up was that's the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system that's one of them there's a few but in general they're very well partition.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and honestly if you, if you like, this kind of stuff but you don't really want to dig too deeply into it go to.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the class I taught is basic human anatomy and i'll give you all this stuff without the lab it's a three credit lecture class you'll learn all about the body in a very simple overview it's really good.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you want, I can throw I can give you guys some of my lectures from that I taught that class a few times.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, which is why I know this stuff that's why like when I first started teaching I didn't teach anatomy and physiology I didn't know any of that stuff until I started teaching it and so now, I can pull that in for you guys the majors and give you a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: But here we are right and I don't know there's no such thing as a parent system, the endocrine system is historically name to take into account all cell signaling.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the body that includes power can signal it doesn't include cell cell recognition that's everything's doing that all the time parent and different growth factors, hormones and basically anything that gets.\nAndrew Ippolito: created from a cell, with the goal of influencing another cells behavior that's the endocrine system.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the exception to the immune system, there are. Andrew Ippolito: signaling molecules and the immune system we don't call hormones, but we're not going there right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: When a hormone does tell a cell what to do, there are two basic pathways that have evolved, the first they both involve a receptor okay so think of this as a ligand receptor situation, just like enzymes and substrates liggins interceptors.\nAndrew Ippolito: If that signaling molecule is hydrophobic.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like a steroid hormone. Andrew Ippolito: That hydrophobic molecule will freely enter into the cell freely go into the nucleus and freely find around its receptor protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's how steroids work steroid hormones so there's an estrogen receptor there's a progesterone receptor there's a testosterone receptor there's receptors these receptors are not what, in your mind thinking, the traditional here's the cell membrane and here's the receptor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's two classes of receptors there's there's. Andrew Ippolito: steroid hormone receptors.\nAndrew Ippolito: which are in the cell. Andrew Ippolito: And then there are the receptors outside on the surface of the cell and those are the ones we're going to be focused on today we're not going to cover any of this in the class other than be aware that they exist.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so basically some hormones are protein based and some hormones are lifted based.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your book will go into more detail than my study guide will require, you have the limited based ones in particular, there are steroids, and then there are ones based more on.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11 - Cell Communication (Ch.11.1-.3) and The Cell Cycle (Ch. 12)","link":"https://youtu.be/9kNHcRALZmA?si=WeYiy58o75dZA-LA","chunkTitle":"Kinases and Downstream Effects","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito provides examples of different types of kinases and their downstream effects.

Andrew Ippolito: walk up somebody.\nJulia Lakchin: from outside. Andrew Ippolito: Would you say Julia. Julia Lakchin: Like signal signal to them outside.\nAndrew Ippolito: How about like knock on the door. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah so let's think about that now, when you knock on the door right when you're not on somebody's door.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're creating a sound. Andrew Ippolito: That sound is driven by your energy bop and into the door and then, on the other side.\nAndrew Ippolito: The vibrations the seeds of wood door the vibrations from the would hit the air, the air then transfers that energy into the south, so you get the soundwave because into somebody here and they hear it somebody that the door.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you what's what's actually entered the House think about that what what got into the House.\nTaylor Campbell: Energy. Andrew Ippolito: Energy yeah exactly isn't that cool like nothing actually came into the House like information did.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you you sent information through or percussion wave basically.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in the same basic way not sound waves, now the cell is going to have something knock on it like a knocking on the door and the way that works is through this process called a signal transduction pathways Okay, the word transduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's it's it's kind of hard to find how to. Andrew Ippolito: Define that in English, without already knowing this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Usually, if you see like if you Google transduction on biology you'll talk all about viruses viral transduction that's how viruses send their genes into cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: In English, the word transduction when we transducers things transducer means to basically move in move over into a different medium so, for example, you ever put your ear.\nAndrew Ippolito: On the railroad tracks and you can hear the train coming from miles away because sound will carry through the dense metal way faster than the air, so you will hear something coming if you have your head, you know when you're on track.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or if you put your ear gets a door you take a cup and put it against the door, you can hear people on the other side right so transduction as the idea of being with the past things across boundaries.\nAndrew Ippolito: Different media. Andrew Ippolito: But we're gonna do is we're gonna come up with the system here we're gonna reveal the system here we're using a series of proteins bumping into each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the basic idea so here's here's the concept, you can imagine, something binding here so let's call this the primary messenger.\nAndrew Ippolito: The primary messenger binds to the cell through a receptor very specifically.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Actually, actually i'm sorry guys this, this is actually.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is supposed to be a protein, so I want you to see this this thing right here this circle that I just read that's an enzyme let's say.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you see how that enzyme can activate not just one but multiple downstream partners that themselves are enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: That themselves can now activate another bunch So do you see how I can amplify one signal into many signals very quickly.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is called a signal cascade. Andrew Ippolito: And there's one universal mechanism this happens in every cell on earth through phosphorylation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's why I focus so much on that in the last couple of chapters this idea of phosphorylation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember that phosphorylation is adding a phosphate group to a substrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: So does anybody remember the name of the class or family of enzymes that phosphor all the things.\nAndrew Ippolito: kinase kinase kinase. kinase is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our a class of protein, they are enzymes and they catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group to their substrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: So Oh, by the way, Julia when I said that 20 Minutes that was how long it takes once the stimulus goes away and like you're not being freaked out anymore, it takes about 20 minutes to come down from that, but the adrenaline can last longer than 20 minutes.\nJulia Lakchin: No yeah I know I was just saying that because. Andrew Ippolito: i'll tell you after class okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then Tyler so the primary messenger is another way of saying yeah yeah it's another way of saying the signaling actually you would say the signaling molecule is the primary messenger the primary messengers that first thing that comes to the door and says we gotta grow or whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: So for our purposes they'll say the same thing I can't think of another.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm trying to think of an exception to this but I can't right now yeah let's say the same thing so signaling molecule primary messenger.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason I said primary message or we're going to learn later about the secondary messengers, and so the concept of secondary messenger makes more sense when you understand that there's a primary messenger.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so this is a kinase this would be an enzyme that fast for leads and so these all get phosphor related and then guess what these are also kinases So there you can also call this, you can see a phosphorylation cascade you can see a kindness cascade.\nAndrew Ippolito: So i'm going to give you a real example of a class of these kinases they're called might engine, we learned that word already my attention activated.\nAndrew Ippolito: Protein kinase and so they're called map case.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this right here let's say this is map K.\nAndrew Ippolito: The kindness that phosphor ELISE map K is called map kk that's a map kinase kinase.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, this primary one up here is map KKK this is map kinase kinase kinase and we do actually named them this way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those aren't names of specific ones, those are classes right like like we learned about nucleus is or protein cases their specific Those are just broad categories alright, so this is a subcategory of kinases my agent activated.\nAndrew Ippolito: So one really liked the name of one would be irk.\nAndrew Ippolito: E rk it was like one or two those are the names of the actual proteins and we're not going this now we're getting to molecular biology and we're just stop it right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so that's the idea of multi step amplification signal cascade.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I said all this already so so the reason I drew the boat imagine there's a boat in the ocean.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's a person there at the in the crow's nest looking out at the ocean for threats and they see a boat racing at them really fast they get on the walkie talkie or they get on the radio and they say, down to the engine room or down down to the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Captain you know the enemy's incoming and so somebody pushes a button somewhere and the whole ship goes on alert right and iceberg now whatever we're not thinkable.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, but think about that one person in the crow's nest is able to very rapidly they go down, they talk to another person or maybe there's three people.\nAndrew Ippolito: That are on that same radio that all here the alert and then those three people.\nAndrew Ippolito: All tell another three people, and then a buttons pushed somewhere in every section of the ship so everybody starts seeing the red blacks on going off the air and, and that means everybody goes to the battle stations.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we can go from one person seeing one boat to 1000 people being activated within seconds in the cell it takes thousands of a second to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so single application good. Andrew Ippolito: we've already talked about phosphorylation so i'm not going to dig into the details too much here, but here are here's the slide on kinases now here's the official invocation of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's protein kindnesses there's limited kinases there's carbohydrate kinases there's nuclear side kinases okay so so basically there are kinases for all the macro molecules we previously learned about you can phosphor late anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so examples i'm just giving you some examples here we're going to learn, and the next chapter about CD case.\nAndrew Ippolito: By the way, start getting comfortable with the idea of alphabet soup.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's gonna be lots of acronyms in these areas, when we learn about genes and we learn about protein names, most of the names of things in molecular biology are acronyms because otherwise they're all mouthfuls.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so like well learn about like so find me Dean kinase or a fastball fruit we you've seen this you saw this guy in the last chapter during the homework and that slide I told you have to study right that was one of the key enzymes regulating like calluses Bosco fruit do kinase.\nAndrew Ippolito: But then, you see all these acronyms and we're going to see a lot of acronyms coming up.\nAndrew Ippolito: So start to get to know them a little bit cycling will learn about that, during the cell cycle cycling's or proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, these kinases depend on whether or not the sequence there so that's why they're called cycling dependent kindnesses and they're actually the ones that drive the cell cycle as we'll see in a bit.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Any questions yeah. Alexa Deprisco: So, like the carbohydrate kinase.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh no I can't hear you. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, oh wait. Andrew Ippolito: hold on one second.\nAndrew Ippolito: I have to turn this back on i'm so tired take that knowledge, you know this thing just randomly shut off, you know it's plugged in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's got a little droid lights on come on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, should be able to hear now. Alexa Deprisco: Can you hear me now. Alexa Deprisco: Yes, like the commercial Okay, so these that you have listed here protein kinase kinase is what i'm So these are all classes of enzymes that would phosphor ELISE that specific macro molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're not named after their. Andrew Ippolito: target they're named after.\nAndrew Ippolito: Their either what makes them turn on or the pathway they're involved in not their downstream like we're used to like everything we've talked about to this point in the semester we talked about the names of enzymes is their downstream target.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right in this case a cycle independent Chinese doesn't phosphor ELISE cycling's it actually.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has. Andrew Ippolito: A whole bunch of downstream targets.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so one thing that we're going to learn as we move forward. Andrew Ippolito: Is this idea, but actually what we're learning right now what you're starting to get an inkling of this is for everybody, not just Alexis everybody listen to this is very important.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you're starting to run the secrets of how cells really work that's what molecular biology is all about okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Genes make proteins proteins do everything and.\nAndrew Ippolito: Everything is driven by gene control. Andrew Ippolito: And genes are controlled by proteins not enzymes necessarily there's all sorts of stuff that I haven't even begun to teach you.\nAndrew Ippolito: One would be called a transcription factor it binds to DNA and it turns the gene on like little little switches those things get activated by kinases it gets complicated.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're not going to go too deep down the rabbit holes, but to just kind of what the appetite here, these kinases have many downstream effects.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not just one it's not like this thing breaks DNA it's more like this kindness phosphorylation this transcription factor that turns on that transcription factor and also turns off this transcription factor it's a web of things.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's the complexity it's kind of amazing. Andrew Ippolito: So when you're learning these things learn their jobs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why they're they're what they're doing not what they're fast for our lady necessarily but why they're there what what pathway are the controlling.\nAndrew Ippolito: CD case control the cell cycle. Andrew Ippolito: Okay map ks activate pathways they have downstream consequences."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11 - Cell Communication (Ch.11.1-.3) and The Cell Cycle (Ch. 12)","link":"https://youtu.be/9kNHcRALZmA?si=WeYiy58o75dZA-LA","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Cellular Control Mechanisms","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the fundamental role of cellular control mechanisms in all cells and their universal nature.","start":"30:47","end":"31:17","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right.

Andrew Ippolito: The next class is a little easier because you have this concept already have a channel protein, the idea of just flooding the cell at ions downhill Member, we talked about it earlier today facilitated transport.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea of allowing an eye on to freely enter across the membrane going downhill now just add to that an ID card right or a button, so the idea is is the Channel can open and close depending on whether or not the signaling molecule is bound to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So take the idea of a receptor and merge that idea with the idea of a channel protein and now you have what's called an eye on gate or ligon gated a ligand gated Ion channel.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you push you you put the signaling molecule in the hole, and then the Channel opens and when the login comes out it closes again.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's it that's literally all say about it examples of that would be things for sodium or calcium.\nAndrew Ippolito: monkey so ligand gated calcium receptors login gated sodium channels.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can you can imagine, now a hormone might control that.\nAndrew Ippolito: If that's a hormone now the cells getting saltier."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11 - Cell Communication (Ch.11.1-.3) and The Cell Cycle (Ch. 12)","link":"https://youtu.be/9kNHcRALZmA?si=WeYiy58o75dZA-LA","chunkTitle":"G Protein-Coupled Receptors","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces G protein-coupled receptors and their activation of G proteins, leading to downstream cellular responses.","start":"42:40","end":"46:52","content":"Andrew Ippolito: If that's a hormone now the cells getting saltier.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Now this is the important one, and this is the one you should really pay attention to.\nAndrew Ippolito: So i'll break the name down right away, there are a class of proteins called G proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the reason they're called G proteins is because they use GDP remember ATP okay GDP that's what the GM GDP is they are activated by GDP if we remember GDP is producing the Krebs cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: And usually it's converted to an NTP. Andrew Ippolito: You can see GDP as a much, much stronger molecule than ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like three times more energetic. Andrew Ippolito: So so it's an expensive molecule you can imagine a cell has to really be rich in energy in order to use this stuff, and this is used in all your carrier's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Part of the cost of being so complicated. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so G protein that's what a G protein is now we have receptors that are activated by God, and so we have G protein coupled receptors and that's where the name comes from gpc RS a GP car is a receptor that can be activated by the GP.\nAndrew Ippolito: or I should say I haven't got the cart before the horse, I should say that it's coupled not activated so, in other words the receptor converts the G protein from a dormant state to inactive state right which makes sense, we got a ligand coming in to do something.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here, look at forget the words and look at the picture right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right let's look at this first picture here, so there is a membrane protein and integral membrane protein, this is one that I remember when I just due to the seven spans.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like time to say seven there that's because these things that you have to know have seven spans they're all the same, in that sense there's a highly there a highly conserved family of proteins, they all kind of look the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the extracellular domain has a binding site for a ligand. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so he So this is the GP car right there that's the G protein coupled receptor okay this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Teal colored thing that's the inactive G protein so that's nurses peripheral peripheral protein and it's currently bound to GDP, remember that ATP and a dp right triphosphate di phosphate this is going die philosophy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Quantity anti philosophy. Andrew Ippolito: And then we got some enzymes generic right just because there's there are dozens of these different pathways So this is the generic version.\nAndrew Ippolito: What we're gonna do in this, so this next picture here is we're going to bind the signaling molecule to the G protein couple of receptor.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is going to instigate the G protein losing its GDP, so it associates GDP gets dropped off and in its place, a G tp comes in, so it allows it to swap out an old battery for a new battery.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the way to think of it. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so now we have an active G protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: The active G protein once it's activated goes in does its thing and what it does, it will activate some enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: That will then go in cause some cellular response.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then to turn it off see here the p that's the inorganic phosphate dissociating so when you first for lead, something you can also undo that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, sometimes there's an enzyme that will do that and i'm going to give you the name for the opposite of a kinase so kinases are opposed."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11 - Cell Communication (Ch.11.1-.3) and The Cell Cycle (Ch. 12)","link":"https://youtu.be/9kNHcRALZmA?si=WeYiy58o75dZA-LA","chunkTitle":"Phosphorylation Cascade and Cellular Response","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the phosphorylation cascade and how it leads to various cellular responses, including gene expression.","start":"46:52","end":"50:42","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, sometimes there's an enzyme that will do that and i'm going to give you the name for the opposite of a kinase so kinases are opposed.\nAndrew Ippolito: By things, called phosphate cases.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, these are opposing force enzymes kinases add phosphates possibilities is remove foss foss feeds.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, have a kindness activate something the possibilities inactivity it's it it's a way of turning things off again.\nAndrew Ippolito: On off particularly difficult for elite.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, sometimes the phosphate will associate naturally it'll just fall off.\nAndrew Ippolito: right back to our slide.\nAlexis Micewski: and Andrew Ippolito: yeah. Alexis Micewski: I have a question just step two so unlike ATP GDP isn't turned into GDP it's just removed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, so no, no, there, there is.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is a let's call it the GDP cycle, because we learned about the ATP cycle it's just not a universal energy mechanism it's specific to certain things in the cell, and this is one of those things is specific to so in this case.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, they do so this GDP where's my house this GDP will fall away, and then it will be taken into a situation where it gets us for later to get and comes back as GDP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it just doesn't have that happen on the G protein. Andrew Ippolito: All right, good good question.\nTaela Shahid: I have a question about. Taela Shahid: um so once the enzyme gets activated because they have to go to transduction first or visitor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's a great question so actually you'll see i'll tell you what i'll jump ahead, really. Andrew Ippolito: quick. Andrew Ippolito: Just to show you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is this I just jumped ahead, this is what you're going to this is your specific case study.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright So here we have a G protein coupled receptor that binds to the G protein, and so the ends the first enzyme it activates is called a dental they'll cyclists so here's a dental Cyclades what a dental a cyclist does is it takes ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it converts it to cyclic am P so there's your secondary messenger a secondary messengers a small easily to fusible molecule that can go throughout the cell and spread its word.\nAndrew Ippolito: So in this case the dental cyclists get stimulated to start producing a bunch of cyclic amp lots and lots of it that cyclic a MP it's downstream target is another kinase called it's got a boring name protein kinase a.\nAndrew Ippolito: And at that point protein kinase a is actually one of these sorts of.\nAndrew Ippolito: crossroads, it depends on the cell we're in the organism we're in the genes that are on this, the cell response down here can be many, many different things.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, think of this as a modular component, you can swap in like an engineering, you might buy a little self contained kit that lets you connected to bluetooth and turn things on and off, and if you, you can attach that to any machine you want.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so this this basic. Andrew Ippolito: The G protein coupled receptor G protein and dental cyclists cyclic amp P protein kinase a that whole thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can bolt that on to many different situations and have many possible downstream consequences, so the enzyme in the generic welcome back to this, but so let's go back now to where we were earlier."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11 - Cell Communication (Ch.11.1-.3) and The Cell Cycle (Ch. 12)","link":"https://youtu.be/9kNHcRALZmA?si=WeYiy58o75dZA-LA","chunkTitle":"Complexity and Cancer","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the complexity of cell signaling pathways and their role in cancer development and growth.","start":"50:42","end":"52:54","content":"Andrew Ippolito: You can bolt that on to many different situations and have many possible downstream consequences, so the enzyme in the generic welcome back to this, but so let's go back now to where we were earlier.\nAndrew Ippolito: The enzyme here when we say enzyme this is generic and it will investigate that relay molecule situation it is it's itself not part of it, but it starts it.\nAll right, good. Andrew Ippolito: You know what let's let's say it is part of its the first part of it, because it does create a whole bunch of cyclic amp.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then eventually something shuts it off some faster paced comes along and inactive beats it okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: or any other questions. Andrew Ippolito: All right, and you'll see here to 1234567 it's always seven that's G proteins i'm sorry that's gpc.\nJulia Lakchin: This might be a stupid question, but what is that for like. Julia Lakchin: Like for what process.\nAndrew Ippolito: Many processes so one one example would be when your liver me and it's what your book uses when your liver needs to suddenly release a lot of sugar like during.\nAndrew Ippolito: An adrenaline surge like the fight or flight instinct right, you need to pump a whole bunch of sugar into your bloods you can have energy to run or fight.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here so here she response, this is your like what's it for here's the response right you see glycogen glycogen remember glaciers in your liver it's that polly saccharine glucose so there's an enzyme called glycogen phosphor ELISE.\nAndrew Ippolito: That it will ultimately activated enzyme that will start popping glucose off this chain and releasing them into your blood.\nAndrew Ippolito: And notice that we go from a single molecule of adrenaline.\nAndrew Ippolito: To 100,000 active enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is one example of when it's used there are many others, but this is the general idea.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, my first class in Grad school was was a class that basically was a tour of."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11 - Cell Communication (Ch.11.1-.3) and The Cell Cycle (Ch. 12)","link":"https://youtu.be/9kNHcRALZmA?si=WeYiy58o75dZA-LA","chunkTitle":"Interactive Pathway Browser","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the Reactome website, a resource for exploring and understanding the complexity of cell signaling pathways.","start":"52:54","end":"57:53","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, my first class in Grad school was was a class that basically was a tour of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Dozens of different single in cascades and modeling cancer so there's like this, this idea of you know, a going to be going to see going to do there's there's a whole.\nAndrew Ippolito: website i'll show you later bye next time.

Andrew Ippolito: me see there's two of them here there's one here there's one here and that's our stuff is cluster on the memory, so this is actually the the real complex, and you can kind of see how the sticking up here.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's that's where the reception occurs, and you can see down here there are these regions that will be activated or that will interact with the G pretty.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you see all the Alpha jealousies, so this is a great you can see, the primary the primary structure, if we pull all the sound like did the amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right this here's some secondary structures here there's some alpha Ulysses and then here would be the tertiary structure and then this whole thing would be the cautionary structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now the rest of this stuff here we go here's the website.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called this is called the reactive.\nthere.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so here i'm not going to actually show you the react to them, this is the website, so this is something researchers use frequently let's look at the so you guys can see my screen okay let's let you click on pathway browser.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the rabbit hole watch this I can zoom in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's glucose metabolism, this is going to show me all the pathways there's like calluses so look at look on the left here here are all the enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: associate with like college, this is the regulation of like causes. Andrew Ippolito: Here here are the circuit diagrams this is molecular biology, that this is the difference between molecular biology and biochemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: biochemistry would be dealing with the actual interactions molecular biology focuses on the interplay and interactions between things and basically building the wiring like understanding the circuits.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, when you look at these kinds of diagrams these universal things you see you see this hour right here, these when you see that line there that's inhibitory whereas when you see an arrow that's positive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this would tell us, whatever fruit one of us probably like fructose one phosphate will inhibit whatever this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: This will activate this this will activate that it's a web this and it's insanely complicated alright, so if I zoom all the way out here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's go all the way back to the root here.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm here see signal transduction so here's the root of signal transduction and if we zoom into this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here you go signaling by receptor piracy kinases we just learned about those right and so let's look all the way down here signaling by this is a platelet derived growth factor.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you see all the you see the alphabet soup now you're starting to get that Okay, I mean I can sit here right now and for an hour I can just rattle off various acronyms and what their names are.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's how many there are there's so many of them it's disgusting I might not be able to do it as well anymore it's been a couple years but right, but you see this they're all these acronyms here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay signaling by these are all five, these are fiberglass growth factors.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's herbs Okay, so this is all I don't know it's i'm like tilting my head, so I can read this stuff so some of the things we're learning about will be here.\nAndrew Ippolito: In addition to a whole bunch of other things right now, this is interesting what's this if I click here ah OK."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11 -

Andrew Ippolito: So, again ready gpc are you going to know this is going to be quiz questions you know me test questions on this will burn this into your head.\nAndrew Ippolito: g protein couple receptor activates the G protein which activates the downloads Cyclades which which takes ATP and makes it cyclical MP, which is that's the secondary messenger So you can see here.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's the primary messenger there is a secondary messenger and then the cyclic MP activates protein kinase.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, many things can happen from there.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here is one example of the downstream pathway after pk so here's protein kinase a.\nAndrew Ippolito: In this case, so in our insulin response i'm sorry in our in our glucose activation response we're going to take protein kinase a and we're going to us formulate another protein called phosphor ELISE kinase.\nAndrew Ippolito: which in turn will activate glycogen phosphor always.\nAndrew Ippolito: In glycogen phosphor ELISE removes a phosphate group from glucose in glycogen and that's what causes it to dissociate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: I want you to focus on this part to get into your head, I want you to know up to protein kinase say you don't have to memorize phosphor ELISE kinase and glycogen phosphor ELISE.\nAndrew Ippolito: But this is really Julia, this is the direct answer to your original question about like what's an example of one we could actually use this and this happens in your liver.\nOkay.

Andrew Ippolito: Is.\nAndrew Ippolito: The process by which this complex eukaryotic cell goes through a growth phase and then ultimately divides into two identical daughter cells So the first thing I want you to do is remove the idea that mitosis is cell division it's not mitosis is nuclear division.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the nucleus is so important, it does its own thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this slide in front of you this beautiful microscopy this is immuno fluorescence and if you go to the bottom, right here and click on that.\nAndrew Ippolito: This will take you to a website of the lab that produces these amazing images they've gotten when I was in Grad school I did a lot of cell imaging and a lot of them, you know for essence.\nAndrew Ippolito: Since I left the lab in 2006 there have been a lot of advances in microscopy and visualization techniques that make me rule they're just amazing because that's that's the stuff that really got me into photography.\nAndrew Ippolito: So some of this stuff is just it's just so mesmerizing and incredible what they can do now.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a lot of this stuff is even in live cells they've mastered these techniques that let you take living cells that have glowing parts that watch you track them in real time so there's all sorts of amazing stuff here.\nAndrew Ippolito: The most important. Andrew Ippolito: focal point in all of this will ultimately be our genes and our genes are within chromosomes so understanding chromosomes is going to be a key point to this entire unit.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, this is going to lead us into genetics and ultimately into DNA structure and function and ultimately into gene regulation right so from this moment until that's the last day of class.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're now going to have itching in the back your head the whole time genes and genetics and chromosome okay it's all about that they're, the most important.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we're going to end today i'm gonna spend the next six minutes talking to you about we hold on did I do it again.\nAndrew Ippolito: No one o'clock we're done at one right yeah Okay, so what you're looking at here is the higher levels of DNA organization So the first thing you're going to master here is how DNA goes from a double helix.\nAndrew Ippolito: up and wraps up into its functional relevant components and that's what I teach now and i'm not even going to use the slides here i'm going to whiteboard this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let me. Get rid of all this here.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's how it works. Andrew Ippolito: Right so here's oh i'm not gonna do here here's okay here's the double helix.\nAndrew Ippolito: We remember the basic structure of this from our early. Alexis Micewski: I can't see anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh i'm sorry i'm Sorry, I have to share my. Alexis Micewski: I thought I shared both my whiteboard.\nThere we go sorry about that. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, you can see now okay so here's here's the DNA double helix we learned the basics of how this will put together so one thing you can do is go back and just quickly review.\nAndrew Ippolito: The double strand that he likes and the nucleotides coming together the five of the three of the anti parallel yada yada.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so one important fundamental here is that this molecule is negatively charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I want you to know just in the back your mind DNA double helix negatively charged, that means that it's going to be staticky anything that's positive can stick to it okay that's the basic idea.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember i've said earlier, the DNA. Andrew Ippolito: is never found.\nAndrew Ippolito: Make it. Andrew Ippolito: In the cell. Andrew Ippolito: There is never a moment in time, when DNA looks like this in real life ever it is always interacting or associating with proteins always.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: The way our chromosomes are built the most fundamental unit of structure comes from these class of proteins called histones.\nAndrew Ippolito: You carry yourself histones are cans have histones bacteria do not.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's one of the fundamental differences in the domains of life is our can that's one of the things that makes us more like our cans than the bacteria that's why we can't put bacteria in our cans, in the same grouping anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is uniquely are can and eukaryotic histones they have these kinds of names there's H1.\nAndrew Ippolito: H2 so there's H1 a. Andrew Ippolito: there's H to a.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's H3 H4. Andrew Ippolito: You know what i'm messing this up hold on a second where's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Each to each to each.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so it's called an October.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is called the history.\nAndrew Ippolito: and actually this I just grabbed a random image on, let me, let me get a better one here.\nAndrew Ippolito: That shows you all.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually that's kind of a cool picture here this this is more molecular Lee molecular Lee accurate if that's a word So you see the dark blue that's the entrepreneur.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so what I want you to see in this picture, particularly this right here, you can see a best you see that it's hard to see this because the DNA is kind of grew light Gray, you see, others DNA right here so here's the idea, take a PIC a soda can.\nAndrew Ippolito: And an old phone cord. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and wrap that phone quarter around the soda can twice exactly twice, so that you get here i'll draw you can see it's better if I try so here's the cylinder.\nAndrew Ippolito: Get rid of all this now here's a cylinder this cylinder that i'm doodling here represents the histone October.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this cylinder represents this thing right here it's just a simple cartoony version of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then DNA will be in yellow and i'm going to draw the double helix as if it's a single line again for simplicity, so you can see, this right, so the DNA comes in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: It wraps around once.

Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we call this complex in general, this is the word I want you just from now on, you don't see chromosomes are made out of DNA you don't say chromosomes are made out of DNA and protein you see chromosomes are made out of chrome it.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, this word is going to be part of your everyday life now here chromatin is simply DNA plus protein.\nAlexa Deprisco: So, as the chromatin like a string of these like nucleus. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah yeah yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so now we're we're gonna do. Andrew Ippolito: Is we're going to apply energy and we're going to twist it, and so, once you can do this now, you can do this follows her and take some string tie it to a pencil Okay, and then take another part of the string tied to a different pencil.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then start just sit there when next time you're binge watching netflix just twist them in opposite directions just keep applying what's called super coiling.\nAndrew Ippolito: and actually one thing that I did last semester here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I use this model now if I take my drill and I take all this and I grabbed my drill with this, so if you have an electric drill.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some somewhere in your House you clamp this down this, this is an old wire that I grabbed from some broken lamp or something and I put this around.\nAndrew Ippolito: A woods piece of wood, because I don't want to do is to my hand and I turn the drill on and what the drill did was this i'll just do a little bit of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here, let me attach this to my. Andrew Ippolito: To my foot and i'm going to twist this like this here i'm just twisting right now, so this is mechanical this i'm super coiling this and i'm going to do this and off here.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's good exercise. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, take it off my toe alright so yeah you can just see i've twist it looks like double stranded DNA but watch this watch this if I so there's a lot of tension in this now lots of energy in here don't care some more.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay watch this when I just relax so i'm going to now take the distance from my hands i'm going to bring my hands together watch what happens to the rope to the wire.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that. Andrew Ippolito: This is called super coiling, and this is exactly how we build chromosomes okay so chromosomes are always under tension.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I took some scissors like let's see I did this to the nth degree let's say that I really took my maybe i'll do this for you guys on a Wednesday i'll get my power at my drills Actually, I have a impact driver.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually, would probably break this wire, so it will twist this so much that this will develop a lot that you can see, actually there's some look at that there's already there are those are chromatin loops.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we see all sorts of these calls sheeps that just come out of what you can think of this is not theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's a whole physics environment that talks about tension and strings and knots and all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So go back to the PowerPoint now. Andrew Ippolito: Can you guys see my PowerPoint to share my screen again.\nAndrew Ippolito: Can you see it okay. Andrew Ippolito: There we go this this right here here first this look so go there's your double helix there's a nuclear isms the next level up is called the solenoid and this word isn't written here.\nAndrew Ippolito: My haste to find there is, I can find my stylist here we go this is called where's my house, this is generally called the solenoid.\nAndrew Ippolito: A solid line traditionally is a piece of metal with a copper wire wrapped all around it to make a super magnet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in DNA land, we also call this a solo annex it looks like that so each purple thing here, each of these here are nucleus, this is also sometimes called a 39 Amir fiber.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is like this is chromatin that's pure romantic. Andrew Ippolito: If you keep going and you zoom out you now get this looped chromatin.\nAndrew Ippolito: and honestly right here, is where we draw the line. Andrew Ippolito: For a cell, that is just hanging out not dividing okay chromosomes in our nucleus, naturally, you can't see them as organized units.\nAndrew Ippolito: They are fluffy and dispersed. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so it turns out, scientists and elucidated have discovered their native state.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what this is your book doesn't call it, this this has to be in the textbooks but it's not so i'm giving it to you this thing is called because it's got such a cool name it's called the fractal.\nAndrew Ippolito: globule. Andrew Ippolito: A fractal is a mathematical pattern that is scale independent use them all the way into it or use them all the way out of it, and it has the same shape.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of a coastline on Google earth if you zoomed into the east coast of the United States, and you saw the jagged little sea coast and you kept zooming in.\nAndrew Ippolito: You couldn't show me a picture of black and white image of that of just the coastline and tell me what that scale was it might be one inch equals 1000 mile or 100 miles or might be one inch equals 10 feet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's what a fractal is in math it's this idea, this concept of scale free shape this is that okay and here's the beautiful part if you look that's the front cover science from 2009.\nAndrew Ippolito: Each color represents a chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: That you know what not no that's not true, not in this picture each color represents what we would call a chromatin territory but notice there's no knots.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you see that do you notice there's no tangling anywhere, you can grab that if you were to make you know if you were to take a bunch of paper clips and make that shape this this flat grid of this weird twisted shape, you can grab any random area here.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's just say right here let's imagine we grabbed it right there at that red dot and pulled on it look what would happen, we would get.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, depending on how hard you pulled you would get a little bit or a lot, but it would fold out very elegantly.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we could put it back again. Andrew Ippolito: Okay that's how our chromosomes turn chunks on and off okay that's it's this tangled organization and so chromosomes now, you can see here take up.\nAndrew Ippolito: A defined region of the nucleus. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, these are called, these are called chromatin.\nAndrew Ippolito: territories.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there are composed of loops of chromatin. Andrew Ippolito: Some of them are dense and tight.\nAndrew Ippolito: And those regions are associated with genes that are off that's called header row crompton, this is an important word to note to header row chromatin.\nAndrew Ippolito: associate that with off associate that with dense okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: The fluffier areas where the active genes are. Andrew Ippolito: is called you chrome into.\nAndrew Ippolito: associate that word with being on. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so at any given moment of any given day when it sells hanging out living its life its nucleus is in this state a fluffy chromatin with regions that are dark and hidden and fluffy and open.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's the level of detail, we need to know right now. Andrew Ippolito: For how chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: are reached Okay, so we are at 110 i'm already over time here so i'm going to stop and we're going to pick up right where we left off on on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Wednesday Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so i'm gonna stop my share, I see a chat message yeah sorry Julia."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 11- Supplement -

Andrew Ippolito: So one of the ways, not the definitive way, but one of the ways we can distinguish different species is by counting their chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: different species have different numbers of chromosomes, this is a special number for a species, so we call this number the end we would say for humans, the number is 23 and we'll learn more about that women do genetics really when we do meiosis okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Since we're on that topic sexually reproducing organisms."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"Cell Cycle Phases and Chromosome Duplication","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains the relationship between the cell cycle phases and chromosome duplication, and introduces the concept of sister chromatids.","start":"9:13","end":"10:23","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Since we're on that topic sexually reproducing organisms.\nAndrew Ippolito: sexually reproducing species.

Andrew Ippolito: If you're not a less number on your high school, you might have felt for 12 hours like that's normal that's not lazy that's your brain, you need that you need sleep sleep is so important to life as you get older.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like by about by the time he was reached by 26 years old you'll stop to need as much sleep and you'll notice that you can wake up a little earlier than normal.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, by the time you get into your 30s and 40s papers down like I I can I can i'm fine on six hours of sleep most days now, or I used to need eight.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now I just need about really ideally six and a half, seven would be you know the ideal, but so so like us when we're sleeping.\nAndrew Ippolito: The alarm goes off that's our growth factor, and so what this tells the cell signal transduction pathways we can think about this, then we have mapped case we have a receptor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're gonna do is trigger an entire cascade of signal transduction I want to teach this to along these lines now.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't usually teach it like this, but this we just got done talking about receptors and signal transduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so a bomb glossing over it, the idea here is we're going to turn.\nAndrew Ippolito: On genes. Andrew Ippolito: That push us into s phase.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, that so think of G one as preparing the cell to entrust us.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what we're gonna do is we're going to turn genes on those genes are going to come on and they're gonna start doing things.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, one of the genes that gets turned on is called a cycling gene cycling's cleanse or proteins that only get expressed during a specific fields of the cell cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there are G one cyclones there are, so there are two cyclones and there are em cyclones.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is how the cell knows, to keep going forward.\nAndrew Ippolito: What a cyclist do they buy into a kinase called a cycle independent kinase or a CD K.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the CD key is always there. Andrew Ippolito: Those genes are always on those kinases or always present when the cyclones show up and bind to their partner that activates them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just like a G protein couple of receptor activates G protein, just like cyclical emp activates protein kinase a cyclist activate CD case, and so you get what's called a cycling CB K complex.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first cycling to wake up is cycling D.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can remember this word D, the A, B D don't be a deep thing to be deep deep they're cycling de cycling cycling cycling be and that's the order they go in.\nAndrew Ippolito: cycling deactivate cycling cycling he activates a cycling a activates be cycling be active hd.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your book does not go into this level of detail and i'm not going to ask you, specific detailed questions on this, but this is part of the circuitry of life that just makes sense used to do this, we do this, everybody does this."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"Cyclins and CDKs","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the role of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in regulating the cell cycle and the order in which different cyclins are activated.","start":"37:58","end":"41:08","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Your book does not go into this level of detail and i'm not going to ask you, specific detailed questions on this, but this is part of the circuitry of life that just makes sense used to do this, we do this, everybody does this.\nAndrew Ippolito: In fact, these some of some of the circuitry was discovered initially and you cells okay so here's how it works ready i'm going to give you a visual of this to make it easier so here's time I should use the whiteboard here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is gonna be really cool you're gonna like this, this this, this is a very elegant system, this is time.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is expression level. Andrew Ippolito: When I say expression level turn the gene on make the RNA make the protein here's the protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and we're going to use colors here.\nAndrew Ippolito: cycling D. E.\nhey. Andrew Ippolito: And being now your book is going to call cycling, be the my tonic promoting factor or MTF So if you see, I know it's so it's the it's at the end of the game cycling be is what's going to help mitosis happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: So your book is going to describe this as MPs. Andrew Ippolito: Which is a cycling see DK complex, the reason why it's got two names, because it was originally discovered in frog oh sites.\nAndrew Ippolito: And called although here's there's, a factor that promotes mitosis and then, when they figured out what it was molecular Lee they're all it's a cycling CD complex so cycling be sometimes has this MTF name.\nAndrew Ippolito: But here's so here's how we're going to do it right G zero. Andrew Ippolito: g one, let me move this time down here oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: minus i'm. Andrew Ippolito: g one.\ng two. Andrew Ippolito: All right, watch this cycling D so cycling D expression levels during quiescence is non existent.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: My agents bind to the cell my agents activate a signal transduction pathways that signal transduction pathways leads to the gene for cycling D to be activated cycling D levels come up.\nAndrew Ippolito: cycling D will bind to it see DK partner.

Andrew Ippolito: Now here's where things get interesting.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the things cycling he does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is inhibit the expression of cycling de.\nAndrew Ippolito: cycling D levels.\nAndrew Ippolito: go down. Andrew Ippolito: Because cycling he levels go up and that same is true now for cycling a so cycling a gets turned on.\nAndrew Ippolito: By cycling he. Andrew Ippolito: Like when he shuts off he.\nAndrew Ippolito: said he couldn't he levels go down. Andrew Ippolito: and cycling a turns on cycling be.\nAndrew Ippolito: cycling be levels come up for mitosis and cycling be shuts off cycling a.\nAndrew Ippolito: and cycling a levels go down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then, ultimately, once the south finishes the cell cycle cycle MP levels go down.\nAndrew Ippolito: The mechanism by which they shut these off, so this is all controlled by phosphorylation just like everything else we've talked about right, so we have so CD case for us for our lead and then there are things, called cycling kindness inhibitors ck is, these are phosphate thesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: And those are the ones that shut things off, so there are ck is controlling.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know if your book gives you that detail or not I can't remember I want assess you on ck eyes, but you're getting this now, you see the phosphorylation.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know that that activates you know that phosphate cases in activated i'm giving you the names of these things, this is how the world goes around.\nAndrew Ippolito: Go ahead alexa. Alexa Deprisco: So, like what is the link between these like geez cyclones and these de cycling.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: Between the what cyclones. Alexa Deprisco: The Justice league because we talked about like inside the cycle, it was like G one s.\nAndrew Ippolito: Jeff oh OK OK. Andrew Ippolito: yeah there's alphabet soup at this point so you would say that cycling cycling D is the G cycling.\nAndrew Ippolito: cycling he say actually I in directly correlated these with the with the chart Let me give it to more explicitly here i'll use 'em use a different color here.\nAndrew Ippolito: purple pink I guess fuchsia okay cycling D is associated with G one cycling, he is associated with s phase cycling aids associated with g to cycling be as opposed to embrace.\nAndrew Ippolito: It so if you're just remember D A, B and then you know G one G two.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the USA cycling D is the G one cycling cycling, he is the SP cycling cycling as a G cycling gee i'm sorry GT GT.\nAndrew Ippolito: You still look a little confused. Andrew Ippolito: or your process. Alexa Deprisco: wiser two names for them.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the G one G two m that's that's how we there's lots of things that happened during the cell cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so s phase synthesis phase we have DNA polymerase doing its job we have sister chromatin is being made.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a whole bunch of stuff going on here during G one G two the cells taking on water they're cranking up the rhizomes and i'll teach you all this in a second.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's a lot going on, and so, those are the names of the cell cycle steps or the the phases of the cells like.\nAndrew Ippolito: cycling D Second, the second, the second be there, named, you can think of those as arbitrary names there's no rhyme or reason why it's D or e or a or B, probably in the way they were."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"Apoptosis and Cancer","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses apoptosis as a natural process of programmed cell death and its role in preventing cancer.

Andrew Ippolito: All right, it's an expensive enzyme we don't want to just have it there all the time, we only needed during this one period of time in the cells life.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we're only going to manufacture it. Andrew Ippolito: When we need it, and so the way we control that sort of thing is by turning genes on and off at key moments so cycling D, which is activated right by the nitrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: So management bites of the cell signal transduction turn cycling dion cycling D then goes and turns on DNA plumbers, among other things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so it's starts the machine weeks the machine up everything starting to wake up and do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, where it's like you're getting out of bed in the morning.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So we can reduce this complexity now.\nAndrew Ippolito: By simply saying. Andrew Ippolito: So step back now get rid of the complexities and just say this growth factors.\nAndrew Ippolito: stimulate the cell to start the cell cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the first phase is G one. Andrew Ippolito: The cell during G one is getting ready to divide.\nAndrew Ippolito: and think about the basic requirements of dividing a cell and half you're going to need to get bigger right the cells are going to need more water so they're bringing water in.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're going to need to ramp up their protein production they're going to need other enzymes, which means we need more ripe isms they're gonna make more ripe isms okay so that's the free under the microscope we don't see anything it looks just like it's just a cell under the microscope.\nAndrew Ippolito: The only way you know something's going on as if you chemically analyzed it doing fancy experiments so in the early days of all this, we could just see the salad say it's just growing.\nAndrew Ippolito: The only visual distinction, we had under the microscope was mitosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here's The first way we define the cell cycle it's think of it like a clock right.\nAndrew Ippolito: The cell starts growing. Andrew Ippolito: And then, at some point.\nAndrew Ippolito: It goes through mitosis mitosis last like this long so we'll call this m phase.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the rest of this it's not dividing so we're going to call the rest of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: The in between fees interface. Andrew Ippolito: So that's why we have that word interface is simply this broad generic you're in the cell cycle, but you're not going through mitosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because in the early days of this when all we had was the microscope to observe things we didn't have any of the biochemistry or molecular biology, we could just look, all we did was watch those go nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Nothing nothing, nothing, nothing no divide so so there was so they were clearly there were two things they were doing, they were either not dividing and then suddenly dividing mitosis takes I think in a normal human cells like 20 minutes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is why, when you're looking at cells in culture, you almost never see it because it's such a quick event why because it's a dangerous thing cells don't want to get caught with their guard down.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they do this fast. Andrew Ippolito: Once we started to parse the molecular biology of this once we started to distinguish what's going actually going on in the cell, we were able to take interface and start subdividing it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's where your G one G two are okay, so you can see.\nAndrew Ippolito: g one G two that's interface. Andrew Ippolito: And then you have employees so interfaces subdivided into G one G two.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the simplest way to think about all this is just each phase is getting ready for the next phase.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the molecular circuitry is this that's all driven by cyclists.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can actually understand to with with with this idea here, you can see life uni directional you can't go from aspect that you want.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like burning your bridges. Andrew Ippolito: invading army comes and then the captains of the army, destroy the boats, so the army has no choice but to go forward.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the ruthless ways that conquers make their armies do their job.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now that said. Andrew Ippolito: So, like I just kind of been both this idea of it being irreversible.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so what happens when your when your alarm goes off in the morning you wake up, you get conscious and you hit snooze and you're fed back into dreamland.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's this idea of being able to kind of come in and out of consciousness there's this idea of being able to come in and out of the cell cycle and the reality is there's a point.\nAndrew Ippolito: within one. Andrew Ippolito: Where the cell could So if you withdraw the growth factors, the cell can go back to sleep again.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this correlates to the whole signal transduction cascading gene expression yada yada yada if you take so you know you treat the solid growth factors they start their cat cascades they start turning genes on if you remove the signal.\nAndrew Ippolito: Factors the agents, the cells can stop doing all that and they could go back to sleep.\nAndrew Ippolito: that'd be a little grumpy. Andrew Ippolito: But, just like you finally planting your feet on the ground and committing to consciousness every day and standing up and doing whatever you're going to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: A rolling over and turning zoom on. Andrew Ippolito: You reach what's called the restriction point or the our point sometimes it's just our, this is the point of no return.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can call this a state of mito janneke independent growth you don't need my agents anymore, the cell is just gonna might a gigantic independent growth we don't need my agents they're done they've done their job they can go home now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: At this point, the cell has a choice to make.\nAndrew Ippolito: I either can divide. Andrew Ippolito: or go kill myself that's it.\nAndrew Ippolito: divider die that's the divide or die.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is where we start talking about death, a little bit now. Andrew Ippolito: You see, that blue arrow see a blue arrow right there that's called a checkpoint.\nAndrew Ippolito: By checkpoint is a moment in time for the cell during the cell cycle, where it assesses itself for damage its health and it asks itself self can I keep going on, or should I kill myself.\nAndrew Ippolito: If its DNA is damaged. Andrew Ippolito: it's going to try to fix itself not going to give up just yet, it will arrest.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called cell cycle arrest, so a cell has my agents added to it, it is dividing it is in G one, and then it gets hit with some UV radiation.\nAndrew Ippolito: or a carcinogen, and something damages this DNA the cell stops and it tries to fix itself at the same time it's trying to fix itself it's quietly also turning on all these machines to kill itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called programmed cell death and it's called apoptosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, at the bottom of the screen apoptosis that's how you pronounce that word if you don't pronounce that word right you found my class.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's apoptosis, it is not a pop doses.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you hear another Professor say a pop toast is tell them die try says you're wrong and make sure you see in a really sarcastic voice so the heat, you can see, well, nobody likes being told that they're pronouncing things wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they're pronouncing.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you stay after class will tell you the story of this this word it's like a trigger point for me at this point.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so apoptosis you can see a potosi's a potato separatists, as you can see a pop the second piece silent and you definitely can't see able to assist that's just silly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so a potosi's apoptosis program cell death, the cell has genes and puts energy into neatly offing itself it's ritualistic cellular suicide.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the way we remove cells from multicellular organisms without eliciting an inflammatory response or any kind of immune response, it is a natural cell death and all of your cells on the surface of your body are dead, right now, from apple."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"Mitosis and Cell Division","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of mitosis and cell division, including the phases of mitosis and the division of the cytoplasm.","start":"56:25","end":"1:05:24","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This is the way we remove cells from multicellular organisms without eliciting an inflammatory response or any kind of immune response, it is a natural cell death and all of your cells on the surface of your body are dead, right now, from apple.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your body is shedding cells at a rate of 100,000 per second and you're making 100,000 new ones per second using my growth.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they're balanced out that's why you don't get bigger and bigger and bigger the cell death equals the cell growth okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's say that the cell does not have damage, and I can keep going, then it gets through s phase.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's another checkpoint in s fees there's another checkpoint in g to notice that there at the boundaries there's a g to em checkpoint there's a G one s checkpoint that's how we talked about them.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the checkpoint, this is the G to em checkpoint, and this is the Inter s phase checkpoint I think those are the ones, your book talks about there's other ones there's an interface checkpoint but your book doesn't give you the details here go ahead alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: Really quick, what is the difference in between this restriction point versus the checkpoint. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: The restriction point is recognized is that moment in time, when growth factors can be removed from the environment and the cell will still continue to divide anyway, whereas before the our point if you remove the growth factors, the cell will stop and go back into classes.\nAndrew Ippolito: In one arrest it'll just go back to sleeping.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas a checkpoint is a quality control, but this is what protects us from cancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are cancer protections and multicellular organisms because mommy look at cancer, we see, they all have a disrupted cell cycle, in fact, you could define cancer as a state of cell cycle pathology.\nAndrew Ippolito: or a state of cell instability.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some cancers will have a mistake in the G one so i'm gonna have an energy to him, but basically sells camp sense their damage or they sense their damage they can't do anything about it and they can't kill themselves.\nAndrew Ippolito: The machinery to kill themselves has been rendered inactive from initiation they can't activate apoptosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a Now you can really understand cancer here at a broader level ready cancer isn't just sell cells growing where they're not supposed to its cells drawing when they're not supposed to and also not being able to die when they're supposed to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when a normal cell removes itself by accident from its environment, it will kill itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys remember integrations number one we talked about two cells talking to each other and we talked about them being able to tell so when sell stop that handshake.\nAndrew Ippolito: They kill themselves. Andrew Ippolito: that's a protective mechanism to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so basically this contact point is each cell reassuring each other, they should they should keep living.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Julia Lakchin: So a little off topic, but it's like related to like cancer, so when someone gets chemotherapy what does that do.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: chemo therapeutic agents. Andrew Ippolito: And radiation therapy targets cycling cells, remember, I told you like 90% of your cells are in cycling.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's why you can take chemo therapeutic agents and and not kill the cell so chemotherapy agents target the cell cycle and so only sells going through the cell cycle will die those that are in G zero walk.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the cells in your body that aren't going through the cell cycle or your hair follicles your skin cells your endothelial cells your microbiome in your gut.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so people that are exposed to chemo therapeutic agents that's why they get sick you've killed all the bacteria in your gut now you can't really eat that well your hair falls out and your skin gets lesions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the idea of all chemotherapy is kill the cancer cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: But don't kill the good cells. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so the idea is.\nAndrew Ippolito: That you need to be healthy enough overall to survive chemotherapy. Andrew Ippolito: If you are not a healthy person if you're not exercising and you smoke a lot of you drink a lot and you're really overweight and you're just not taking care of yourself and then you get cancer and go the doctor the doctor says.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I need to treat you with this level of chemotherapy to kill your cancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is going to kill you. Andrew Ippolito: I can only give you this amount this isn't going to kill you but it's also not going to kill the cancer so basically your cancer is going to kill you.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what happened my cousin curtis he got skin cancer and he was also really not taking care of themselves, it has big weird lump underneath his arm he waited too long ago the doctor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they came with the doctors told them that they could not give him the dose the lethal dose for the cancer, because he wasn't healthy enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yet. Andrew Ippolito: So, think about life as training for the big day.\nAndrew Ippolito: everybody gets cancer. Andrew Ippolito: that's the reality of it if you live long enough, you get cancer, not necessarily the worst time that kills you right away, something else will kill you obviously everybody dies right.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is stuff we don't usually think comfortably about talking about, but the idea is is cancer is the other side of evolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a double edged sword. Andrew Ippolito: Right, you need to change in order to keep up with the environment and cancer is all about change, so the key is keep the organism alive long enough to have kids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, after that nothing matters for them anymore. Andrew Ippolito: From an evolutionary perspective right every organism has a kind of a program def point like tortoise is live what like 300 years we live about 70 to 100 years depending right that bowl, on the other, room last couple months.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, these are programmed responses that can be overcome, and so there are some people now that are researching death from the perspective of death is a curable disease, just like any other disease that natural death aging that aging is a disease that can be cured.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now it's looking into a car and get into a car accident die. Andrew Ippolito: But if you're careful, some people are saying the first person to 1000 years old, is alive today right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then there's a question of who wants to up to 1000 years old, all right that's it that's a totally different question.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: here's another way of looking at the cell cycle, this one now digs into a little bit more detail so you can see interface, you see interface here.\nAndrew Ippolito: At one sgt there's interface, and now we can break em face down and there's your mitosis and now you can see mitosis is part of emphasis.\nAndrew Ippolito: The other part of this thing here called psycho can nieces.\nAndrew Ippolito: site to sell can he says move we're basically splitting the cell and half this is where the cytoplasm divides.\nAndrew Ippolito: Everything else or glossing over this because we still don't fully understand it and it's insanely complicated my so think of the mitochondria the er the goji the proximate like everything kind of evenly partitions itself in half.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's called. Andrew Ippolito: starts.\nAndrew Ippolito: After my toe so really this slide isn't even that accurate let's let's do this here here's the reality of it, this is mitosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright pro phase mcafee's Anna fees caliphates trophies trophies and a face to face.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay side Oh, can he says begins let's see how much somewhere and Anna fees and continues after to feed into the next one, so it bleeds into the next cell cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: site to kind Nice.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so these are two independent events there's there's nuclear division and cytoplasm division cytoplasm division begins, a little bit more than halfway through the my topic division.\nAndrew Ippolito: and ends after mitosis is done.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you'll see it once you see more of this it'll make more sense but that that's all say about that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: This gives you a kind of a way to think of a 24 hour clock This gives you the relative durations of each of the phases now, you can see that mitosis is really short."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"The Cell Cycle and Mitosis","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the different phases of the cell cycle and the process of mitosis.

Andrew Ippolito: Send essence that was that word I used earlier when Angela talked about sales that can't vs don't at the moment okay so that's how they that's how they present themselves getting cancer alright guys divide nope.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, and this is controlled by their telomeres shortening. Andrew Ippolito: So remember the chromosome remember how the end of the chromosome it turns out every single cell every single time cells divide their children gets a little shorter.\nAndrew Ippolito: little shorter a little short until it starts cutting into important areas and when that happens that's when the cells stop dividing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Cancer cells are immortal. Andrew Ippolito: there's a cell line.\nAndrew Ippolito: That hasn't been growing since the 1950s, called the killer cell.

Andrew Ippolito: and honestly my brain when I see this and think about this, this is probably one of the ways in which cells can pick up DNA and do things with it.\nAndrew Ippolito: In unusual ways, in other words it's not just mutations that drive evolution there's something called horizontal gene transfer when some organisms actually get DNA from others.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think that this is all unknown right now, this is me conjecturing to you off the cuff, there are probably mechanisms by which cells will take up these apathetic bodies.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then do something with the DNA that's in there and sometimes that helps cells and Bob why just or mutate in certain ways.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think this is one of the mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer.

Andrew Ippolito: So this what you're studying here when you look at this, this is molecular biology when people say like me i'm a molecular biologist, this is the level of detail I studied things that I didn't look at.\nAndrew Ippolito: The three dimensional protein structure bindings and they all that stuff I mean I occasionally would do that, but really it's more about trying to understand how the circuits work this protein bumps into this protein that makes this thing happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like reverse engineering a machine. Okay, all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now let me, let me, so I guess i'll end this apart, how do you say the word.\nAndrew Ippolito: apatow says was discovered in the early 70s. Andrew Ippolito: It was published in the British journal of cancer in 1972 by curb wiley and Curie and when they.\nAndrew Ippolito: discovered this mechanism, they actually went to a professor and another university that they were trying to figure out what to call it, and had some fun with it, they were like this is a novel process we have an opportunity to name this thing, and so it turns out.\nAndrew Ippolito: This paper was published, it was a little footnote and explaining how the word came and how to pronounce it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they said they were most grateful to Professor James cormac of the Department of Greek University of Aberdeen for suggesting this term that we're not potosi's and so in the original, this is actually written in Greek letters.\nAndrew Ippolito: But I change the font so the word you can't pronounce it Greek spelling about ketosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: is used in Greek to describe the dropping off or falling off of pedals from flowers or leave some trees and other words natural forms of cell death not pathology.\nAndrew Ippolito: To show the derivation clearly, we propose that the stress should be on the penultimate syllable the second to last syllable.\nAndrew Ippolito: The second half of the word being pronounced like doses, and it says it with the p silent, which comes from the same route to fall and is already used to describe the drooping and the upper eyelid.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you Google this word here in Google image search you'll see people were one I is just closed but it's very weak like this, like i'm pulling my eyelid down there so there's no muscles and gives them muscles are dead, it just falls that's called tosses.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so aiko means. Andrew Ippolito: to break away, I think, and toast this is to droop so apoptosis is the natural falling away of cells that's the way.\nAndrew Ippolito: It is now I had a student, unlike so that's why you pronounce it that way, and once one student focused on.\nAndrew Ippolito: where's my mouse, we propose and they're like no we're gonna say a pop doses, because that honestly even researchers I study this if there's two fields of people here it's like a war going on about how to say the word so most people say a pop quizzes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Probably because when you read the word style in your head, you cannot see pop.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, so I jokingly say to my students, if you pronounce the word wrong you felt my class that's how important it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason why this is the thing for me is that my very, very, very first time ever, teaching anybody anything in biology my advisor came up to me and say, can you please give a lecture to the first year Grad students on cancer and oxytocin in the cell cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when I was putting the slides together, I remember thinking myself, how do you see this word because everybody says it differently, I heard you know all the different ways, so I just thought I went to the library."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"Cell Cycle and Mitosis","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the stages of the cell cycle and mitosis, including prophase, metaphase, and anaphase.","start":"1:49:58","end":"1:53:41","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And so, when I was putting the slides together, I remember thinking myself, how do you see this word because everybody says it differently, I heard you know all the different ways, so I just thought I went to the library.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I dug into the stacks they call them would you guys are never gonna have to experience this probably back to this is like 1999 this like 2000 2001.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, back then, most things were getting put on the Internet, but if you needed to look at older journal articles, you still had to go to the library itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: down into the archives and was called the stacks just you can go, you can look at science from 1856 it was really cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so I looked it up in the card catalog and I found this and the first page explained how to say it, I didn't think this was contested I just told my students about it and it turns out, the very first class I ever taught how to Greek fluent speaker native from Greece.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he said actually the words pronounced populaces. Andrew Ippolito: And I was like well.\nAndrew Ippolito: in Greek, it is, but this this isn't that word, this is borrowed from that word and its program cell death it's not flowers falling off i'm sorry not pedals final flower that's a populaces.\nAndrew Ippolito: in Greek. Andrew Ippolito: apoptosis is program cell death in this up totally different, but you it's the same word.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, that's that's my little fun story about that so. Andrew Ippolito: Now something about homeostasis in our bodies at every moment of every day, you are making 100,000 new cells through mitosis my cell division and 100,000 cells are dying throughout potosi's.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so homeostasis is maintain so long as the rate of growth equals the rate of death mitosis equals opportunity.\nAndrew Ippolito: If the growth rate is greater than. Andrew Ippolito: The overall mass increases, and so you can think of a solid tumor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like my poor dog Buttercup she's got this massive fatty tumor on our side that she's actually going to have to get surgery for.\nAndrew Ippolito: which I never thought i'd like to see the day I give a dog surgery, but here we are.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's okay i'm okay with it it's like the whole her whole side at this point you've just this big round mass it's probably the size of a small kickball at this point and she's only like this big.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a it's not invasive it's so it's a benign tumor but it starts putting pressure and places it gets so big like it starts but it's starting to she's painting.\nAndrew Ippolito: she's starting to get you know pressure on the lungs and the heart she's starting to sleep in weird places now so that but, but the bed keeper.\nAndrew Ippolito: Two days ago she went to the vet and the vet said turn that we can probably take this out very easily and she'll have you know higher quality of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: The rate of growth is greater than the rate of death solid.\nAndrew Ippolito: If it's the opposite if the rate of death is greater than the rate of growth now you have what are called degenerative diseases.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you've heard about a bunch of these parkinson's disease alzheimer's disease muscular dystrophy aids anytime we have cell slowly dying and population is the rate at which the replaced is lower, or they don't get replaced at all, like in terminal differentiated neurons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's that's that. Andrew Ippolito: that's the cell cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we talk about cell division all, which is a slightly different take on things right you guys can see unit three lecture three does that say that there for you.\nCan I share my screen right.

Andrew Ippolito: let's let's dig into this now, I want to.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want to give you the visuals here this isn't you know fluorescence this is live cells well, these are fixed cells that are now dead, but they've been stained and particularly."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"Metaphase and Chromosome Alignment","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate and the separation of sister chromatids.","start":"1:55:13","end":"2:06:02","content":"Andrew Ippolito: I want to give you the visuals here this isn't you know fluorescence this is live cells well, these are fixed cells that are now dead, but they've been stained and particularly.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's how you see this blue you see the blue Okay, the blue is his DNA, so in this slide the color blue is DNA, the first thing you notice is that the nucleus itself is still pretty well intact okay don't worry about the shape of the nucleus don't ignore the pinching here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is actually. Andrew Ippolito: just ignore the pitching here. Andrew Ippolito: All right, green the green color are the micro to people's.\nAndrew Ippolito: notice it's chaos okay that's what tells us this is interface.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's one of the things there's three hallmarks here the nucleus is still intact, you can see a well defined nuclear boundary.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't see any details of chromosomes in here it's all just blurry blue, so the chromosomes are D condensed.\nAndrew Ippolito: But if you look carefully here you'll notice that there is a very large centrism that looks like it's starting to form spindles.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why we know it's cheap to. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll also see the nucleus, which is generally a dark area and the nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: It wants stain. Andrew Ippolito: So a traditional generic immuno fluorescence that this is a nucleus you'll probably see a hole somewhere, and now we call the nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some cells might have a couple of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: The red, which is kind of a control here, those are the mitochondria. Andrew Ippolito: That you can start you can now, you can kind of see a step back and just look at all the red for a second like that's how many mitochondria so has a cell can have a few hundred to a few thousand depending on what kind of sentence.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's you can also see you think of it as like a bacterial infection that's the size of bacteria right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So what you're looking at here we can zoom out now, we can see, this is a colony of cells, all in interface they're just hanging out.\nAndrew Ippolito: There, these are quiescent cells. Andrew Ippolito: or they're in G one or s or GT.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's hard to say because we're just looking at the microscope and we don't have any context, so all we can say about these cells is that they are not currently going through mitosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can distinguish a G one cell from an s from a GT unless you can start to parse the central zone.\nAndrew Ippolito: and see the various spindles race Oh, but it's a look, look at the green.\nAndrew Ippolito: And look for the centrism. Andrew Ippolito: You can see it in each cell is generally next to the nucleus right so here i'll circle them here's the centrism here here's the centrism here's the centrism here's the central zone right but that's where the this one's low this might be off camera or that's part of the central.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's the Center so notice each one of these has an intact nucleus well defined and now you can start to see.\nAndrew Ippolito: The the you in the header of chromatin so just pick here's four cells on the screen notice that the Blue nucleus notice that there are dark splotches and bright splotches you see that you see the brighter areas, the brighter areas are you chromatin.\nAndrew Ippolito: They can grab the dye very easily because they're open they're fluffy number talked about the paper, so you chromatin is available to get stand hetero competence tight least type, and so it can't get to the same you can also see in the cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see the nucleus, at least, like right here. Andrew Ippolito: But that the bright light areas bright and dark areas hetero chromatin you.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Now we can look at a profile so.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see it's like a bowl of spaghetti you can see chromatin condensation but it's not organized.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can also see the nucleus, in this case is still intact. Andrew Ippolito: How do I know that the telltale sign is that the bright green Center zones are obeying a boundary point here, you see that there's no.\nAndrew Ippolito: spindle fibers going into the nucleus, which means you can't get in there, which means the nucleus is still there, so the nuclear so so the chromatin has condensed.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can distinguish individual chromosomes. Andrew Ippolito: But the nucleus is still intact, you can also see that the centrism there's two of them, you can see that they're starting to move apart here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, in between them, you can see, the early portion of the my topic spindle.\nAndrew Ippolito: and ask you seen us were a few times i've ignored it up to this point let me tell you what an aster is now.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's the cell. Andrew Ippolito: i'm gonna ignore everything except the centrism right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's the pair centrism. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Let me do some whiteboard.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's the cell. Andrew Ippolito: here's the nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's one central zone you don't see the whiteboard i'm sorry. Alexa Deprisco: i'm sorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: I keep forgetting to share multiple parts of my screen everyone.\nkeeps it. Andrew Ippolito: So yeah Now you can okay so here, let me start over so I know that the important thing here is me saying it out loud, at the same time, so here's the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's the nucleus. Andrew Ippolito: here's one centrism.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's another centrism.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, in read i'm going to draw what are called asters so all What about to tell you are, these are all micro two bills, they just have different jobs asters anchor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those centrism to the cell memory. Andrew Ippolito: Okay that's what makes them asters.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that makes sense if you're going to pull something you need to have an anchor point right if you're going to pull somebody up from a cliff you need to make sure you're holding on to something you're going to go along.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in orange notice that these are going completely across the pole of the cell the middle of the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay i'm spanning across the nucleus. Andrew Ippolito: These are called polar.\nAndrew Ippolito: spindle fibers. Andrew Ippolito: Sometimes you might call them polar micro.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are the ones. Andrew Ippolito: That are gonna pull the cell apart, like, I told you earlier, with the dining.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the motor protein. Andrew Ippolito: Okay they're the ones that are going to pull the cell apart ultimately.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then lastly i'll do this in light blue you have your kinetic core micro tutorials the ones that will attach to the chromosomes themselves.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there are three fibers here, there are the astor's that anchor it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or the polar spindle fibers that push the cells apart, and there are the kinetic or micro tutorials that push the chromosomes apart, or I should say pull the chromosomes apart.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right back to the PowerPoint you guys can see that, yes, okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So profile profile is characterized by the condensing of the chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: The formation of the spindle but the nuclear envelope is still intact.\nAndrew Ippolito: So pro metaphysics the next phase is when the spindles formed the nucleus is fragmented and the tug of war is going on, but not finished that's what pro metaphysics.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's pro phase, again, this is a beautiful picture of preface. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, now, why is it read this time that's an artist's you can on a women do this, you take basically take different pictures of different colors under the.\nAndrew Ippolito: microscope and emerging together adobe photoshop and you put each picture into a color channel there's the red the Green and the blue and.\nAndrew Ippolito: For any publication, you would generally put blue is associate with DNA that's just the Convention, but in this, for whatever reason, somebody wanted to be a maverick and make it read.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, but do you see the Center isms you see on the opposite sides and you see how the nucleus is still intact profile.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we're just going to jump to metaphors here i'm not going to show you a picture of pro metaphors pro metaphysics is just the in between part of this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you'll see here you'll see the spindle fibers have last on the chromosomes they've done the tug of war and all the blues in the middle now there's a there's a nice even.\nAndrew Ippolito: line there, you can see that's called the metaphors plate, the reason called a plate is this is actually in 3D right we're just seeing the two dimensional version of this but, in reality, if you tilt it all this to the side.\nAndrew Ippolito: The metaphor is played, so this is a three dimensional cell right so here's the 3D version.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's that's a that's a plane and the chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are randomly scattered throughout that plane it's just that they're in the plane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here's one centrism here's another i'm trying to do is in 3D here."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"Anaphase and Cell Cleavage","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the separation of sister chromatids and the cleavage of the cell during anaphase.","start":"2:06:02","end":"2:10:44","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right so here's one centrism here's another i'm trying to do is in 3D here.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the metaphors plate Okay, so there is no important ordering of them on that plate they're all just there.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's Meta fees, the middle phase. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the moment so so what's happening here is those cohesive proteins, these are the proteins that stick the sisters together right those cohesive are getting degraded and eventually.\nAndrew Ippolito: They get separated, so you can just picture the MIC the spindles as yanking on them harder and harder hard until Finally, they give way and you get hold on, let me just get better you get an fps.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so Meta fees and a face that's the most distinct boundary, and all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you would say that the sister chromatic kids are now full fledged chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so one set of chromosomes goes to the left, the other goes to the right that's it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, now that I said that i'm gonna go back a slide, this is another picture of Meta fees and what's cool about this one is you can actually visually distinguish the sister chrome entities within those chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you see this over here. Andrew Ippolito: oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the add kid that didn't line up with everybody else.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a mistake go ahead alexa. Alexa Deprisco: So when it's splitting up the chromosomes it's not like physically splitting the chromosomes themselves it's just like summer taking like one little pair and summer taking the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: summer. Andrew Ippolito: You lost me at the summer, taking one pair summer taking when you see you say that in a different way.\nAlexa Deprisco: So, like you have the chromosomes that are lined up in no particular order in the Center of the cells and then the the micro tutorials that are attaching to them the kind of course.\nAndrew Ippolito: can of course. Alexa Deprisco: cannot of course okay so like they're not like physically separating the little x's themselves it's just pulling like one over to one side and one over to the other side as like a whole unit of a chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: here. Do you see my screen. Andrew Ippolito: You see my whiteboard.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's one chromosome with to chrome right what's happening.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here are those centrism there is a micro trivial attached either side, like this and they basically yank them apart, such that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So these are you know, so the pink is the cohesive proteins are going to degrade those cohesive, proteins and so we're gonna pull this whole thing apart, so that it looks like this afterwards.\nAndrew Ippolito: like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they're getting pulled away so now this thing here remember the banding pattern each one of those is just a chromosome now so nobody's gotten the chromosome itself has not broken we've just separated the sisters.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this happens for all of them. Andrew Ippolito: And then, in the PowerPoint here you'll see this one didn't separate rate and we'll learn about that, when we do meiosis it's called non disjunction.\nAndrew Ippolito: The red is i'm. Andrew Ippolito: intermediate on it, I think.\nAndrew Ippolito: I say it's intermediate it could be acting it doesn't matter it's a beautiful picture right and and really the.\nWhat is going on here.\nAndrew Ippolito: The point here is that this is the reason, this is so awesome to, as you can see, the very well defined microchip and you can see, this asters.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see the polar spindle fibers and you can see the kinetic or spindle fibers This is like a really, really nice picture.\nOkay.

Andrew Ippolito: Those are just like the default micro tutorials and every day.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, then they really mess, with the colors here, but whatever so read, in this case, you can see the deacon dancing chromosomes right below is the act inside of skeleton.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's the early mid body. Andrew Ippolito: And then here's here's a pair of cells, who are basically done right look at their nuclei.\nAndrew Ippolito: that those are really, really good, you can see the header or chrome on the new chrome to very clearly there nucleus is fully intact, but you can still see the MID body, a little bit so technically we're still inside of cases.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because you can see, this right here. Andrew Ippolito: Otherwise, the cells look like any other, so now that interface.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: By the way, these cells here, this would be what I told told you about in hdfs and normal human deploy deploy fiberglass, this is what they basically like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Cancer cells look different you can immediately spot a cancer cell cancer cells nuclei don't have this nice football sheet to them instead they have some kind of weird.\nAndrew Ippolito: Cancer cells are just all levels of messed up like all the Tom cells or cancer cells, there have so many problems that they're very unlike their cells, they came from.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, this is what the century those look like remember the the configuration of micro tutorials Member the three the nine plus zero configuration there it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can see, this picture here is looking down like see exactly like this, so here's this pair we're going to look down at it like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So ones off to the side, you can see a side view of it, and the other you're looking deep into right, so this is one on the side, and this is one facing up and then this is a side view of a pair of them, you can see one here and one here like that and here's the other pair.\nOkay, so that's the sectionals. Andrew Ippolito: And then the rest of these you can study you can use these to study.\nAndrew Ippolito: But here's here's pro face versus chromatic is here's the official view of that so here's pro fee is the key is the nucleus is still intact for the chromosomes of condensed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Early my topic spindle pro metaphysics is the tug of war is going on, but it's not done yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, when all these settle in the middle that's when you call it.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And then these are just mark pictures from your book beautiful pictures.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this right here, this gives you the good view of the kinetic core and the canonical fibers so what you're seeing here is this, let me.\nAndrew Ippolito: I realized one o'clock tiffany tell me this, this will be the last thing I cover here so here here's one sister.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's the other sister. Andrew Ippolito: And here's this kinetic core and this kinetic core and here are the micro tutorials coming down Okay, so what we're doing is we're looking at this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here that's what this is all right, so you can imagine here's the other parts of the arms of the sisters here's the kinetic core.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's the spindle fibers.

Alexa Deprisco: So, like it sounds like everything like you're saying, like everything gets cancer eventually so like is there any sort of like genetic predisposition that you could get like from your parent when it comes to like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh yeah yeah yeah there's there's there's basically two types of cancers there sporadic cancer and there's familial cancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: So people that have a mutation the very first oncogene ever just i'm sorry the very first tumor suppressor gene ever discovered was bracket BRCA one it's a breast cancer associated cancer and.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's very rare to have a mutation in it like 90 95% of breast cancer sporadic.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the whole idea like well my ankle breast cancer so i'm going to get it like know that just because I mean your ankle cancer that doesn't mean you're going to right, especially if she was older.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you're an 65 and a breast cancer that sounds about right issues 20 or 25 and she got breast cancer that's not right so either she was exposed to some carcinogen, and the environment or she has familiar breast cancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so they go to the geneticists and the geneticists does of research and they don't pull their blood and looks at oh look you haven't mutation in the bracket one gene so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So some people are born with a mutation that basically fast forwards, the rate in which breast carcinogenesis happens.\nAlexa Deprisco: And then, like specifically for breast cancer, because um I guess that's like primarily like illegal cancer for women, but like so if.\nAndrew Ippolito: You get it, but yes my it's much more common and females. Andrew Ippolito: Because they have more breast tissue okay.\nAlexa Deprisco: um so then like if someone like if you someone like on your paternal side had breast cancer, who like wasn't like your dad obviously.\nAlexa Deprisco: Would that G, and if it was like familial breast cancer, do you think that that gene could be passed down to like you, if you like, you're born a girl woman whatever because, like of the I guess the chromosome because it's like the dads gene that determines the gender right.\nAndrew Ippolito: That there's a lot going on there, so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So right, the father gives the the sex of the child, based on whether the extra the y goes right that only if the gene is on the X chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, there are be sex specific patterns of inheritance, is what it's called excellent excellent traits and like color blindness, is an excellent treat with that means of the genes on the X chromosome so.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's out of the family dad's got a brother, that the dad got rest of dad's brother got breast cancer okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does dad have the same gene probably not or maybe I mean 5050 really right for any given gene there's a 50% chance you're going to get it or not get it if it's a simple pattern of inheritance and so.\nAndrew Ippolito: If dad never got breast cancer and had kids right so like if your dad if your uncle got breast cancer that doesn't mean you're necessarily going to get breast cancer it's possible that, if the uncle got breast cancer."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 1) - Cell Cycle and Mitotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/vDNiZofB0AA?si=emsOoepo49Fkooka","chunkTitle":"Cataracts and Horror Movies","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses cataracts and their treatment.

Andrew Ippolito: If you type in hallmarks of cancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just type hallmarks of cancer into Google.

Andrew Ippolito: We have an uncle or grandfather that had a really aggressive colon cancer.\nJordan Russell: My uncle has it again and it stage for this time and his daughter, had it.\nJordan Russell: Oh yeah mother.

Andrew Ippolito: So alexa that's an example of that's not spontaneous now what or the whole family grew up.\nJordan Russell: near. Andrew Ippolito: or radioactive waste dump. Andrew Ippolito: I mean there's there just because we see a pattern of familial inheritance of something don't immediately assume is genetic It could also be everybody was exposed to the same environmental problem, but that honestly, the fact that his daughter had colon cancer that's rare.\nJordan Russell: Did you mean like do you consider Philadelphia radioactive waste. Andrew Ippolito: No, no, I mean no more than any other urban no.\nJordan Russell: yeah I mean. Andrew Ippolito: They grew up by five Mile Island Oh well, that's the.\nJordan Russell: way, it was quite shocking that that my cousin had it. Jordan Russell: And she's in her 40s 20 oh it's like.\nJordan Russell: yeah so she's she has like a. Jordan Russell: know if it's for our or just in general for the cancer, but she has like something she has like something in here the chest to get removed still because she's cancer free at the moment.\nJordan Russell: yeah but yeah her dad is stage for my uncle and then my grandmother had five different types of cancers so.\nJordan Russell: yeah I don't know how that will survive this one, she did she did. Jordan Russell: So yeah I got a I got quite a wide of cancer in my family so i'm hoping that I don't get cancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, we all will eventually it's just a matter yeah.

Andrew Ippolito: Right and by, by the way, this would be meiosis one, this would be meiosis to right so just the First Division second division, the first division, we call a reductive division because we're going from two to one.\nAndrew Ippolito: reductive. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, any cell division that ends with a fewer number of fewer sets of chromosomes is called a reduction of division.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it definitely still becoming a half points that will be reductive until that happens at my house this one.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Otherwise, no excuse for the same as mitosis so here's the rule if you see one on these words without a clarifying Roman numeral like a by just if you just say profane.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's mitosis you've already learned that if you see a Roman numeral after it, that is always meiosis so we'll say Meta phase two or phase one and phase one and phase two and.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's how we distinguish between these. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the easiest way to really master this is to just track a single set of homologous chromosome so ready let's just do this let's take us out so really these are nuclei.\nAndrew Ippolito: chromosome one chromosome one I was just just do one set of chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, up to this point preceding meiosis the cell cycle is the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: You got your Gilan your ass and your GT and really so m is just meiosis now.\nAndrew Ippolito: The same. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so the key here the key here is G is s phase we're going to draw these duplicated chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there you go there is a pair of Homer logs in g.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now we're not going to go for this first act here for this first pass we're going to do this really simply.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so watch this we're going to go pro phase one metaphors metaphors metaphors one, how would that look what we're going to do it manifests here is, instead, and so in mitosis we would have just line them up like this on the medifast plate right.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would have pulled these apart, that would have been mitosis so here's the first difference in meiosis instead of these lining up vertically we're going to pair the hormones like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're going to line up next to each other, in other words the hormones are going to find each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we'll see is this thing happens go crossing over they exchanged chunks of DNA we're not going to do that here just yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's Meta phase one they lined up. Andrew Ippolito: And then everything that happened after this and mitosis happens again we have the silo canisius begins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right all that stuff but here's the key that the sisters don't separate instead the houma logs separate.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that the sisters are still together, so what we're doing is we're grabbing each entire chromosome this time.\nAndrew Ippolito: And pulling them apart, so these daughter cells, these two daughter cells here each now only have one copy of the chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember those sisters should be identical right. Andrew Ippolito: So this cell here is now one in are happily.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's the reduction there we go from this so here, this is to win because it has two copies, and now, each one of those daughter cells has one, and they have one copy and that's the concept of meiosis one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the key to understanding this is what happens during trophies trophies is the most important one to study.\nAndrew Ippolito: And metaphors. Andrew Ippolito: metaphors is easy to understand, but pro feasible, all the complexity half of the crossing over and all that and we'll dig into that in a bit, but right now i'm giving you the roadmap.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now the good news is. Andrew Ippolito: meiosis to. Andrew Ippolito: is essentially mitosis there's nothing new in meiosis to other than you just have one set of chromosomes that's the unique part but otherwise.\nAndrew Ippolito: They line up with the Meta fees plate. Andrew Ippolito: The sister separate.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so now you have four because that happens twice, you have four cells that each have a single set of chromosomes."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 2) - Meiotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/BZbW6PgZDMg?si=FYJouRFKrpJBKZhE","chunkTitle":"Crossing Over and Gene Shuffling","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the concept of crossing over, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, leading to gene shuffling and increased genetic diversity.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so light blue let's say light blue corresponds to mom.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'll do read here. Andrew Ippolito: corresponds to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what I just drew was one. Andrew Ippolito: unduplicated chromosome and the nucleus right so so random somatic cell nucleus there's chromosome one one copy of moms one copy of deaths right and there's a gene there, what makes them houma logs again as they they carry the same genes.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to call this gene a just for simple simplicity sake right we're going to see there's a gene gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: mom carries a capital a copy of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so mom you would say, has the capital.\nAndrew Ippolito: A legal. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the idea is is there's a specific sequence of DNA there at T GG GG CT whatever there's a sequence of DNA that represents the ability to make a protein of some kind, like an enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I say that dad has a slightly different version of it will call our cases.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there are different, this is like the brownie recipe, with or without walls.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the key is it makes the same basic thing they're just two different versions of it, two different flavors of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is an iPhone, and this is an android or this is Pepsi and coke both right that's the that's the idea here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now, what i'm gonna do is i'm going to show you there's a couple of jeans so let's say that this is gene for B.\nAndrew Ippolito: C. Andrew Ippolito: D. E and F.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now there's no reason why the maternal chromosome the light blue, one has to have all capital letters i'm giving them all capital letters just to simplify you being able to understand these concepts is hard enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not gonna like you know, in your math classes, when you first start learning and cost of the math and they throw like big numbers with decimals at you when you're like why can't I just be Andre.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why did you have to give me 7032 i'm just learning the concept there that also i'm giving you 100 all right i'm over over simplifying this so you can see the patterns so dad's gonna have all lowercase versions here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So again, this is like a chunk of a recipe book with six different recipes and each recipe comes in two different versions.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you would say dad has the lowercase G audio and mom has a capital deal we'll.\nAndrew Ippolito: Get you guys are still with me. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So, you could say this or that right, this is a single individuals nucleus right.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, that now right that that's that's your mom and dad copy in your nucleus so that's comes on one we are humans, we have 22 other.\nAndrew Ippolito: chromosomes like this and then the next and the wire next in the next. Andrew Ippolito: Okay Okay, so you would say your gmail type ready for gina your genome type would be a capital a and a lower case say that would be your genome type your genome type is just what illegals you have.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or what illegals are present.\nWhat does that say.\nAndrew Ippolito: What.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not going to teach you Mendel here i'm not teaching you homozygous dominant assess and all that right, I just because again we're doing meiosis right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so it's enough for you at this point, just to understand that there are six different genes on these chromosomes that there a pair of houma logs once a month from dead and there are different levels okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you could write if you wrote capital a B, C D E, F, you could say that this is the maternal genome right, you are the maternal set of genes right and this a B, C D E, F, this would be the paternal set of genes, you can also say.\nAndrew Ippolito: That you have these various. Andrew Ippolito: genome types.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's different lenses you can apply to these concepts, depending on what you're thinking about what the problem at hand is.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK. Andrew Ippolito: Still with me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now imagine imagine each one of the products of these jeans right so watch this I give you this, this is not going to be hard, but this is going to be different than what this like i'm not covering what the book is i'm mixing a couple of chapters together Just to give you this."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 2) - Meiotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/BZbW6PgZDMg?si=FYJouRFKrpJBKZhE","chunkTitle":"Gene Expression","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of gene expression and how it relates to RNA and protein synthesis.","start":"34:44","end":"35:04","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And then each of these messenger RNA gets read by rhizome.

Andrew Ippolito: Right so that's two sets subsist requirements.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the relationship therefore between this chrome minted and this chrome and.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are called non sister chromatic.\nAndrew Ippolito: And those are the ones that will engage and crossing over.

Andrew Ippolito: All right now, just so I can manipulate this i'm going to zoom out for a moment here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to watch me carefully i'm going to animate this so i'm going to take will hear me when i'm just gonna bring this up, I want to bring this up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right here's what happens well there's so there's a complex that does is a proteins you don't have to worry about any of that just the concept here is we're going to do this.\nwe're going to do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's literally so that right there this this physical shape is called.\nAndrew Ippolito: A Chi asthma. Andrew Ippolito: plural.\nAndrew Ippolito: Chi is Mata because crossing over can happen multiple times on one chrome ISM but i'm going to just show it to you on just one just to show you at once right, so what we'll see you can actually see that, under the microscope you'll see this.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll see chaos you'll see a class. Taylor Campbell: And so the question.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah, so this is going to happen with.\nTaylor Campbell: sections like letters that we need for that are the same just different maybe due to like uppercase lowercase.\nAndrew Ippolito: There so here let's look. Taylor Campbell: At some letters back in. Andrew Ippolito: Here i'll just keep let's do a B and C.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so I picked a place for crossing over to occur that happened to sit in between gene a mgb.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see that. Taylor Campbell: Okay, but it's not like it's not a it's not.\nTaylor Campbell: Like uppercase a going into bread. Taylor Campbell: And hey going into blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah that's exactly what's happened because watch this. Andrew Ippolito: Now that i've. Andrew Ippolito: done that. Andrew Ippolito: But that's untangle them now.\nAndrew Ippolito: watch this if I if I untangled all that I went to get.\nAndrew Ippolito: This chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this crop is, and so, if you put the letters back right, this is lowercase a capital B capital C, this is capital a lowercase B or Casey.\nTaylor Campbell: Okay, thank you. Andrew Ippolito: make sense, your. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, so, so the so the original chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so here let's let's now so here's the before.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this would be like step one. Step two.\nStep three. Andrew Ippolito: So the ideas, before, during after.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna we're gonna be able to refer to these as the parental.\nAndrew Ippolito: The parental promise.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can refer to this so again, if this is the capital, a capital B capital C lowercase a lowercase B, etc, we can also let me get rid of the word, random here.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can also call these. Andrew Ippolito: The parental gino types.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right capital a capital D capital C lowercase a lowercase be lowercase those would be the parental unit types right what mom and dad.\nAndrew Ippolito: After recombination we now have lowercase a capital B capital C or capital a lowercase B lowercase E we're gonna call these so these chromosomes these are parental chromosomes these are called recombinant from isms.\nAndrew Ippolito: want to call these recombinant.\ngenotypes. Andrew Ippolito: And what you've just witnessed here this idea of being able to take different sequences of DNA and swap them and rearrange them the generic concept here is called DNA recombination.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's a phrase will use, we could, so we can just as easily replaced the phrase crossing over for read combine.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason why we have these two words is recombination can happen in many different.\nAndrew Ippolito: situations. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so like, for example, retroviruses like HIV, the way they work is they will copy their genome and then we combine it into hours they will put it into our genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: During B cell development of antibodies there's a particular kind of recombination that occurs so country combination is a is a process that can be used in different ways.\nAndrew Ippolito: Within meiosis recombination is used in order to shuffle the illegals together and we just call that specific version of it.\nTaylor Campbell: crossing over. Taylor Campbell: um so in HIV it changes your DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: It know it. Andrew Ippolito: integrates into our genome. Andrew Ippolito: So, like if this is your. Taylor Campbell: chromosome."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 2) - Meiotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/BZbW6PgZDMg?si=FYJouRFKrpJBKZhE","chunkTitle":"Labels and Possibilities","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the concept of labels and possibilities in the context of genetics.

Andrew Ippolito: wow i'm so sorry guys again I can't I I have these like weird disability if i'm talking out loud and i'm teaching I can't go into my math mind that's why I teach biology not mathematics teaching math that would be terrible if I was teaching to nobody I could do it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the idea here, and this my brains not able to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I got it. Andrew Ippolito: So, or if there were if there were three different versions, that would be three to the next, so we got we got two pairs so it's two to the end where, as a number of chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we have because we're human we're to the 23rd.

Julia Lakchin: hold on to oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: never done this on this particular to the power of 23 there we go yet 8 million, this is 8,380,608 that's how many different combinations are are assuming know crossing over.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, go ahead, what are we gonna say.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was talking. Julia Lakchin: I said that I don't think iPhone has that but I was wrong.\nSo. Andrew Ippolito: So now so take that 8 million. Andrew Ippolito: And for each pair of chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do the random swapping seven times.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so we now have to to the seventh her chromosome and i'm not doing this math So this is the joke I accidentally came up with this number so big the exponent of exponent.\nAndrew Ippolito: And another way of thinking of it is, if you take your genome your unique genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: That unique sequence of DNA has never existed before.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it will probably never exist again in the history of the universe given when you do the math and how long the universe is supposed to last that's how big the numbers, you are truly unique in the universe.\nTaylor Campbell: So you don't believe in doppelgangers. Andrew Ippolito: I don't believe in what. Andrew Ippolito: doppelgangers stop okay Well, no, no, so the doppelganger idea is there's only so many ways, you can create a face.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you don't have a fully random patient and I, like you, putting your eyes up here and your cheeks over here right it's not like a Picasso so there's a limited constraint of the actors physical limitations and so there's so many combinations and, on top of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: All modern humans come from a population of about 50,000 starter people in Africa about somewhere around 300 to 200 to 500,000 years ago.\nAndrew Ippolito: So.

Andrew Ippolito: there's no variations and active there's no variations inside of chrome see there's no variations in turbulent these are gold standards that evolution is given us to the variations are in the you know.\nAndrew Ippolito: The subtler things and our biochemistry and and really superficial differences.\nAndrew Ippolito: is only skin deep, so to speak. Andrew Ippolito: Right and that's why the concept of race doesn't exist in biology race is not a biological thing races a sociological thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so just as a way of illustrating that point, if you take earth and you take just two random people from anywhere on the planet."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 2) - Meiotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/BZbW6PgZDMg?si=FYJouRFKrpJBKZhE","chunkTitle":"Mitosis vs Meiosis","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito compares and contrasts the processes of mitosis and meiosis.

Andrew Ippolito: You know it's a great way of putting it. Andrew Ippolito: we're different, but the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have way more in common than we have different. Taylor Campbell: So what about like like when things are bred to close in there and lying like and they go like animals like what if they're bred to close or like people like in the olden days like that, like the how the royal families or want to keep everything close.\nTaylor Campbell: And when you see close you're talking genetically in interbreeding. Taylor Campbell: Yes, so like like How does How does that cause all those problems.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's a. Andrew Ippolito: that's a wonderful question to understand that you'll. Andrew Ippolito: will have to first understand, going back to the dominant recessive stuff right, the key is is having the two lowercase illegals having the two broken o'neill's together at the same time.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's when you generally get bad treats and the chances of that happening are rare within random selection of the population, but as you get bloodlines closer and closer together.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so like, for example, Darwin married his first cousin because that was you know, keep like the Royal bloodlines he was from an old family.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when you marry somebody that close to you any of your reset like everybody's carries a couple of accessible eels.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the chances that you married somebody that has the same accessibility is is pretty low. Andrew Ippolito: But if it's within the family, you have the same sets of recessive Beatles right so that's why in readings bear that's why.\nAndrew Ippolito: families that have close blood pies tend to have a lot of bad things pop out over the generations that's why dogs have modern dogs have all these problems.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, like last OPS is have kidney problems and dalmatians are deaf and that's because of all the inbreeding and that's why we have all these new products coming out like things like snicker doodles.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's why we say months are better right diversity wins every time the more diverse your genome, is the more your chances of having offspring that will survive.\nAndrew Ippolito: to the point where there's a lot of the I don't get I haven't read about this recently, but the idea of two people, the reason why two people tend to be attracted to each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's apparently some level of ability to sense our immune systems being different from each other and so people that tend to have very strong attraction have children tend to have very different immune systems, which is how we survive like our immune systems are highly evolved and.\nAndrew Ippolito: allows us to not die from all the various diseases right. Andrew Ippolito: So so marrying a compliment to me your immune system your kids are gonna have really robust immune system.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's even ideas of that Tele pheromones work like the inexplicably attraction, some people have to each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: is driven by some kind of biochemistry of fairmont. Andrew Ippolito: Sorry, I don't mean to ruin love for you.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's all chemical. Andrew Ippolito: we're all robots no that's not what i'm that's not the implication of the implication is is how we feel and.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our thought patterns are fundamentally driven obviously by our brain chemistry, which can be controlled by several different things, and one of those things is other people's chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: lemon wait what, why do you randomly right lemons oh lemon oh Okay, thank you Julia.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so i'm going back to the PowerPoint here. Andrew Ippolito: there's you're crossing over alright so so the tetrad separate the Bible is separate, you now have this as the reductive division right this cell here is now one.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we obviously so, is it so So this was to end this one out and reduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's less that's that's the hard that's the meat of today meiosis what my ios two is details here's meiosis to each one of those cells has our chromosomes lineup on the manifest played the sister separate and you get a pair daughter cells that are now.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so you can see here. Andrew Ippolito: You can see here, these two cells and these two cells, if you look at them carefully, those are four different cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have completely different genomes. Andrew Ippolito: OK, so the goal of mitosis is to produce to genetically identical daughter cells, the goal of meiosis is to generate for completely diverse daughter cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I said that's meiosis. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can use the rest of the slides to see all the different possibilities and probabilities whatever here's here's an electron micro graph of the Chi asthma, you can see, the actual crossing over the microscope.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: i'm gonna slide This gives you a simple version of everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: We did crossing over Okay, so you can see here, this is an electron micro graph of two cells that have underwent synopsis.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can see the synaptic a more complex here is made out of proteins, the nucleus nucleus, protein and then a lattice just means a highly order structure our scaffold.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, like you can see, I mean look at that you can see lines in there, you can see the lining up here at the molecular level it's crazy how precise this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this slide gives you here's your alphabet soup and the ability of the different combinations of vocals.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is from I want to say this from your book, I honestly can't quite remember. Andrew Ippolito: If the storage from your book or not, but this gives you this is a level of detail, I expect you to have your cohesive hold the sisters together the synopsis any more complex holds the Bible as together.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you can picture this in class, we were in class I would take two meters sticks stick them together, you know just slapping together and then put a bunch of rubber bands on.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that would be a pair sisters and the cohesion complex. Andrew Ippolito: And it will make another one, just like that right so pair meter sticks with rubber bands pair meter system rubber bands and I know we take the two of those together and put them together, and then I take bigger rubber bands, but those and that's the tetrad.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And you can see that that crossing over randomly happens somewhere within that setting up any more complex, and you can see the crossing over occur.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So these are just bigger versions of those pictures.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this I need to get rid of this slide this is. Andrew Ippolito: This is not something that occurs during meiosis This is called a holiday junction.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is something DNA can do, but this is not what occurs during crossing over I actually a couple years ago I mixed up two concepts because of.\nAndrew Ippolito: A more complicated version of crossing over so, but this isn't me, you can see the DNA does the form these occasional so it's like like a crossroads, but that's you don't study this slide I should delete this.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and then these are from my older book simple versions of these you can just use these for your studying here's your crossing over your tie asthma kai's Mata.\nAndrew Ippolito: blah blah blah and that's it that's it that's my house so when you study this stuff, this is a good slide here, you want to make sure you can compare and contrast mitosis and meiosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I didn't give essay questions that would totally be an essay question compare and contrast the processes of mitosis the meiosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: So if you want, in your own studying go ahead and answer that question as an essay and that could be something you like, when you guys meet to do your study group sessions that's the question you want to talk about what's the similarities and the differences between the two mechanisms.\nAndrew Ippolito: into what you got the biggest visual differences metaphors right, you can see here mitosis you have everything's lined up vertically randomly right it doesn't matter where you put the chromosomes there."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 2) - Meiotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/BZbW6PgZDMg?si=FYJouRFKrpJBKZhE","chunkTitle":"Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis in animals. He discusses the generation of sperm cells in males and the development of egg cells in females.","start":"1:30:10","end":"1:41:56","content":"Andrew Ippolito: into what you got the biggest visual differences metaphors right, you can see here mitosis you have everything's lined up vertically randomly right it doesn't matter where you put the chromosomes there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas in meiosis one metaphors you can see that very much matters there's your independent assortment.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and there's a summary comparing and contrasting again. Andrew Ippolito: that's not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Compare contrast compare contrast so now that this little end part here sorry so import here we're going to talk about animals we're going to talk about the specific instances of meiosis so in in all animals that produce sperm, we have something called spur matter genesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: genesis is when we take, we can understand the concept of a stem cell now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so a stem cell in general is a cell. Andrew Ippolito: That goes through mitosis and it produces ready you got this so here you go this so here, those are identical this cell then goes and passive has an interesting life.\nAndrew Ippolito: It can differentiate into a different kind of sell it can go through meiosis whatever this cell will just divide it again.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, this one will have that, whatever that field is right, so you see that that's the idea of a stem cell it always freshly divides into two cells one cell is kind of like the keeper of the torch and the other one goes off and does something.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so like your skin cells are costly renewing themselves because you have stem cells that are constantly renewing yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right one cell always becomes two cells and one of the still stays there and the other starts differentiating into a carrot Tennessee.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, you have stem cells in your blood marrow okay so Superman genesis is the creation of a spark.\nAndrew Ippolito: whenever you see genesis right, just like in the Bible genesis is the creation story it's formatted genesis is the creation of a sperm cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's how it works in in in in a nutshell sperm at a primary site you do one stem cell going into two cells, these are called So the first one is called the primary spur Madison the primary Superman aside as a stem cell it's to me it's undifferentiated OK, so the idea of differentiated.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the cell takes on morphological morphologically distinct appearance, think of the difference between the generic version of like a neuron.\nAndrew Ippolito: which has the axon and you know the dendrites and all that versus say a skin cell, which is a kind of like you can have a plate like cell or you can have like a tall columnar like cell right So these are differentiated cells, they take on distinct appearances or shapes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So stem cells are not differentiated. Andrew Ippolito: And there's a so that sells going to go through mitosis and then you now so really, really there's another cell up here you been that makes that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now we have the primary. Andrew Ippolito: The primary sperm at a site is the cell that interest meiosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the primary romanticized generates secondary sites and that's the reductive division right that's the to end to the one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so each one of these has a duplicated chromosome minute that's random it had crossing over occur with.\nAndrew Ippolito: The secondary sites, then become they go through meiosis to and they become what are called sperm intense it's permitted.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can see, they now have this flagellum. Andrew Ippolito: And they go through this process, it takes about 40 days for them to grow up into a mature sperm.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and so, if you take a cross section of where this occurs i'm not going to teach you the the anatomy really but think of it like this, think of a garden hose with a thick wall.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the inside here is hollow. Andrew Ippolito: The stem cells live on the periphery and they go through their these various phases until they sit in the.\nAndrew Ippolito: interior here the anterior and the think of them like being parked in the garage backwards, so they have to back out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then eventually they'll pop out and they'll go down in the flow down into the tube and they'll travel throughout the testicle and up into the best difference into the.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it takes about 40 days for it to grow Okay, and once puberty hits This is just happening 24 seven.\nAll right. Andrew Ippolito: For the female we have this process called oh genesis it's one of the only words in the English language you'll see double oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, oh genesis genesis. Andrew Ippolito: And what you're seeing here is here's the egg sell so here's a primary so an oversight is an excel or an or sometimes called an Obama.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a big sell it's the largest selling the human body. Andrew Ippolito: So there's this and there's a nucleus it's surrounded.\nAndrew Ippolito: By what are called follicle cells, you can see, those in this picture here zoom in a little bit better, you can see right so those teeny tiny those are cells they're just much smaller cells and it's a three dimensional think of it like a balloon a little balloon Okay, the ovary.\nAndrew Ippolito: The ovary like the testicle has this oval shape and it is filled with these follicles that's what the ovary is is just fill follicles and connective tissue all right, and so, when a human female is born she's born with about 300,000.\nAndrew Ippolito: follicles. Andrew Ippolito: no shortage of of sex sells and by the time they hit puberty.\nAndrew Ippolito: The cells big so So these are generated during jenna during development.\nAndrew Ippolito: So a female human is born with all of her eggs already there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the primary oversight goes through meiosis one, and this is where things get really interesting you don't get to cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: This one style instead of it becoming two cells. Andrew Ippolito: You get one big cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And one little cell and the big eats the little stuff so that you get essentially what so so this thing here is called a polar body.\nAndrew Ippolito: The purpose of this ready, the purpose of this is to ensure that when we're done with this, we have the biggest sell possible.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's the strongest sell it could be, it has the most energy so it's taken that one cell and it's concentrated all of its strength into one cell, but at the same time reducing its nucleus down to being hapless.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this shriveled up husk of a cell is basically the leftovers, the cast the the the garbage dump, of the other half of the genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why we do this is the reason why the oversight.\nAndrew Ippolito: is so big. Andrew Ippolito: is so that it can produce chemicals.\nAndrew Ippolito: That end up here let's go here here so here's the ovary.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then there's a pie remember learning about.\nAndrew Ippolito: This in high school i'm just gonna draw half of it here. Andrew Ippolito: Right what's the name of this remember.\nAndrew Ippolito: might have learned as a Philippine tube. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so what happens the egg so so first of all, this isn't connected, this is this is kind of like.\nAndrew Ippolito: We just had Easter eggs, so I mentioned, I was holding an Easter egg on my hand like this the Easter eggs, the ovaries like this, so they're not physically connected.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, instead, these have a bunch of cilia and the ideas when the egg bursts, when you get that little egg spit out the ideas, these things are flowing fluid in to hopefully suck it into the fallopian tube but sometimes get lost and the platinum.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, some people are actually sterile because their eggs never make their way into the into the uterine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's the egg and at this point the egg starts to produce a massive amount of chemicals that are basically like an air Horn for the sperm.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so they will produce this trail of chemicals that when the sperm comes in, it can sense those and it finds its way up there for fertilization to occur.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if the egg was small it wouldn't be able to produce as many chemicals and the chances of a sperm finding it would be low okay so it's basically it's a heightened go seeking that evolution is given us.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a survival tactic, so, in other words let's here's the analogy let's say you were going hiking in the woods with somebody there was just two of you, before you went out to the woods you agreed that, if we got separated one of us would stand still.\nAndrew Ippolito: And just start yelling at the top of their lungs, the other would go get as many people as possible in calm the forest for you and listening for the sound of your voice Okay, so that one one of our cell stays put and yells and the other comments with the whole armada looking for it.\nAndrew Ippolito: All sexual reproduction does that some most of the time they said mammals and other higher animals.\nAndrew Ippolito: The female is the one with the big sell that stays put in the mail is the one that comes up with the little cells that are their massive amounts of there are occasions where those sex that sex is different, where the mail has the one and the females a bunch.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's the basic strategy. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and this is generally called sexual Marxism.\nAndrew Ippolito: diamorphine to shapes. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so we are a sexually die morphic species.\nAndrew Ippolito: notice i'm not using the word gender. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, about 20 years ago those words would have been interchangeable but as we're understanding the psychology of gender, more and more gender is a different thing gender is a psychological thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: sex is the physical thing, so a cell has you know X, we would call that's the sex of that cell female and the sex of the ex wife's that would be male.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the gender of SL cells don't have gender. Andrew Ippolito: Gender is a higher order thing that happens psychological basically what gender is is your view it's self perception within the context of Community.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when you have these arguments online with your with your buddies on Facebook there's only two sexes like two genders, there are two sexes, that is.\nAndrew Ippolito: kind of true, I mean there are variations, even here there's X oh that's called Turner syndrome there's X, Y Y or X X, Y there's variations or two."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 2) - Meiotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/BZbW6PgZDMg?si=FYJouRFKrpJBKZhE","chunkTitle":"Sexual Dimorphism and Gender","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses sexual dimorphism and the distinction between sex and gender.

Jordan Russell: That was a fee, I thought I thought it was a male. Andrew Ippolito: So here in the mail.\nAndrew Ippolito: What this is what happens that this is the game plays out in the deep parts of the ocean where there's very little nutrients or anything big and slow small and fast.\nAndrew Ippolito: And most males when they're born into the darkness and they just die, but some of them if a male anglerfish finds a female anglerfish you see how he latches on.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then they eventually merged their physiology is such that here, you see, right here that's the mail.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's basically becomes an appendage of the female and he just a pot he responds to her hormone systems and will produce the sperm when she tells them to and then they'll develop eggs yeah it's.\nJordan Russell: This is what bothers the food grows well.

Andrew Ippolito: he'll so no, no, no, the so after the fuse together, he while he.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has sperm, and he provides to go there's meiosis occurring, and he just injects like wherever that there's probably inside of her there's probably some specialized.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oregon that develops as a result of this right, because it's random where he latches on I don't think that he latches on in one place well I could be wrong again the anatomy of all this is here, so in this case he's on her back.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah I mean these you. Andrew Ippolito: it's a male parasite that he's literally a parasite he lashes on their vascular I forgot about this third there vascular surgery vascular systems merge so he's basically his blood is provided by her her blood.\nAndrew Ippolito: And yeah that's that's how you reproduce it the bottom of the ocean where there's no food."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 2) - Meiotic Cell Division","link":"https://youtu.be/BZbW6PgZDMg?si=FYJouRFKrpJBKZhE","chunkTitle":"Life Cycles and Sexual Dimorphism","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the concept of life cycles in sexually reproducing organisms and explains the differences between animals, fungi, and plants.","start":"1:51:19","end":"1:52:55","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And yeah that's that's how you reproduce it the bottom of the ocean where there's no food.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's that sexual die morph ISM and the most extreme example.\nAlexis Micewski: So we.

Andrew Ippolito: cleavage.\nAndrew Ippolito: So anyway, and then then that's developmental biology, if you want to learn more about that you can take developmental biology someday or read a book on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: or your textbook probably has a section on it.

Andrew Ippolito: Oh yeah sure sure okay sorry so. Andrew Ippolito: let's go here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's say that we have some theoretical cell and this cell has.\nAndrew Ippolito: A nucleus, and in that nucleus, there are.\nAndrew Ippolito: two. Andrew Ippolito: Two chromosomes oh nice Okay, so I see two chromosomes that you gotta have to be up so i'm going to be careful how I talk now the genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: consists of right some sequence of DNA right it's just.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's this DNA sequence, you can think of all genomes is just one big one sentence before letters right so let's say this is the human genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So that's that's not a chromosome that's just that's all of the sequences that make up our genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every eukaryotic organism has a genome that has one big long run on sentence of DNA and what you can do is just divide it into chunks into pieces it's kind of like taking your favorite book and dividing into chapters.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it doesn't matter how many chapters, or maybe there's 200 chapters, maybe there's four.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so it's an arbitrary number. Andrew Ippolito: And so we take that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Take that all right now i'm just i'm out of here here let's do it here so for my hypothetical example here i'm going to do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm just going to break it in you know into two pieces. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so now i'm going to redraw that here's the first long piece and here's a short piece.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and i'm going to get rid of this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you see there's two there's two chunks there's two chromosomes okay all species have some number of chromosomes and we call that it's a number.\nAndrew Ippolito: So for this So here we would say this Ennis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Now, one of the oddities of sexually reproducing organisms is the will have.\nAndrew Ippolito: An entire second set of the chromosomes it's like having a backup copy like having two dictionaries or two really good to encyclopedias.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that are written by slave that over time have modified by different editors right they started out the same right so yeah so Imagine you had you know you had an encyclopedia on your shelf.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know ABC whatever and they were the same you know, and then you had.\nAndrew Ippolito: You had a second copy of it Okay, and then many years past and they're edited by different people to randomly mutated over time that's the key here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, like this one will develop invitation here that's one of those mutations you so they slowly die merge or sequences diverge a little bit right, so they started out the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, as time moves on, because because mutation is random those two copies will undergo different mutation events that's what leads to differences between, on the legals.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, are you still with me. Victoria Bloemker: yeah i'm like i'm I was like reading it down was turning.\nAndrew Ippolito: process yeah that's fine that's fine. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so. Andrew Ippolito: So let me get rid of my addiction my my encyclopedias here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So watch this i'm going to just choose the long one, I want to call the long chromosome here's the long term is that we're going to call it chromosome one.\nAndrew Ippolito: will call the short one chromosome to. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, that now what i'm going to do, I want to say that these two chromosomes we inherited from mom So this is the maternal copy of chromosome one, this is the maternal copy of chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and for dad. Andrew Ippolito: somewhere else in the cell i'm drawing it exactly the same a drug differently so because there's no relationship between those two chunks of DNA there's no relationships between those two chunks of chromatin.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's no relation between those two chromosomes okay physically they there they don't care about each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call that pair, though, so let me draw it over here here's the other one here's the other one right, so this is chromosome one you inherited from your dad and chromosome to you inherited from your dad.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let me draw chromosome to somewhere in there Okay, so we would call these two here if I was gonna highlight them, I want to call that pairing or that that that set.\nAndrew Ippolito: A set of homologous chromosomes. Andrew Ippolito: or there's called humble Alex you can see homologous set you can say homologous pair it doesn't matter their home logs the reason their home allows is they have.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have the same. Andrew Ippolito: location.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of. Andrew Ippolito: they're centromere.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they have the same genes.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the same location.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is a very operational definition here you look at these two chromosomes and you're like Okay, they look visually they look exactly the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, what if another chromosome looks like another chromosome but then we wouldn't be able to really look at it visually I just so happens after each chromosome is unique enough where we can we can pull them out of the lineup.\nAndrew Ippolito: nationally, let me give you let me take a. Second.\nOh here let's do this one.\nOh. There we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: There this thing here, this is called a carrier.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a human carrier type a carrier type is a way of visualizing all of your chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now I just randomly grab this from the Internet, and I can tell you that this one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is is not normal Can you see why what's wrong with this carrier type.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's one. Taylor Campbell: there's three. Andrew Ippolito: Ways yes good.\nTaylor Campbell: number eight. Andrew Ippolito: glasses are cut off anyone. Andrew Ippolito: Bottom probably yeah you're right that's. Andrew Ippolito: Right 21 hopes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this if this is chromosome eating here, this must be 1920 2122 and then this is X and y.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can see the sex of this individual is they have two X chromosomes so they're female.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can see that they are trisomy for chromosome 21 that's where i'll introduce two later don't worry if you to trisomy three there's three of one of them Okay, so what you're looking at here, though, if you look on the left hand side.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is called a Meta face bread you don't have to know this for the test, but it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: A spread basically what you do is you take a blood sample you grow some cells in a petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's an asynchronous population meaning they're all over the map of the cell cycle you treat them other drug usually it's a drug called tax all which your book will mention.\nAndrew Ippolito: taxol inhibits micro tubular D polymerization What that means is functionally it leads to an arrest of the men of fees stage of the cell cycle in my direct rightness smack in the middle of mitosis right you can't separate sister chrome and.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you can't depot MRI is micro tutorials and so, if you prevent the cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: machines from working it all stalls, and this is good, because in Meta phase right all the chromosomes are lined up in the in the middle there so then you've lost the cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you can so you can we used to do this lab actually what we call it the splat lab Steve Gus Horn was the one that brought it into the classroom is wonderful, they don't do it anymore and we're not the classroom now, but basically you take.\nAndrew Ippolito: These transform cell lines this transform hela cells which we talked about a little bit and you basically.\nAndrew Ippolito: lice them by dropping them from a pipe pet from about three feet up from the microscope slide.\nAndrew Ippolito: splat and they shatter basically and then you look under the microscope and you see you see chromosomes everywhere it's really cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you can see here that these have been steamed right, you can see the banding patterns right you see the black and the white stripe ease.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what so there's a person called a carrier typist you can be one someday if you're really wanting to you have radiologists right, you have people who do.\nAndrew Ippolito: sonar griffey right people who run the machine that lets you look at babies and then you have stereotype is this will just be another kind of a tech job and you basically are trained to find.\nAndrew Ippolito: All the names of the chromosomes careers comes on one there's comes on to crimson they all have very.\nAndrew Ippolito: Specific signatures. Andrew Ippolito: I always think of it it's kind of like, if you remember in the movie the matrix where he's looking at, although the green lines coming down, and you can see things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right he's like I see a lady in a red dress under that scene that's what this is like I see that you have.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a down syndrome that they just look at that picture on the left and say that they don't have to line it up that's for everybody else the carrier type this can look at this really quickly and say, oh no that's that's bad.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know they'll and they'll probably be able to very quickly see those three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So, in any case now you get it, you can see the home blocks right, so this would be the one you got from mom this will be the one you got from dad right mom and dad and you'll see that there are some variations, like, for whatever reason you'll see that there's a difference there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right or sometimes it's just the nature of the way it was themed right that does seem like to be a big difference there, in any case, but that's a carrier type that's the console our body cells are somatic cells all have two copies of each chromosome so we call that kind of self deployed.\nAndrew Ippolito: And those are the cells that have to. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so N, is how many unique chromosomes are in the genome and then to end says we have two copies of each one right we've doubled it.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense to me. Victoria Bloemker: yeah a lot more Thank you you're welcome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Hopefully that helped everybody.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sorry So where are we here."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 3) - Meiosis and Sexual Life Cycles","link":"https://youtu.be/9yMBF08YiLc?si=GjLZRIlIFQ6rkgZs","chunkTitle":"Animal Life Cycle","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains the life cycle of animals, focusing on the deployment of the multicellular stage and the production of gametes.

Andrew Ippolito: Sexual reproduction likely evolved very, very early.\nAndrew Ippolito: It might have evolved before multicellular or it primarily did evolve before multicellular organisms, it probably evolved coincident with.\nAndrew Ippolito: It probably happened early on in the protests right so So if you think of evolutionary time first we had prokaryotes right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then eventually we had proteus single celled you carriers right and then some of them at each other right and we had our mitochondria and our chloroplasts that gave rise to.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm sorry i'm messing up my story, I should say these guys at each other, giving rise to the protest.\nAndrew Ippolito: And some of the protests right we're photosynthetic and some each other and the produce all gave rise to three lineages that we have today right, we have the animal kingdom, which we call the Meta zones, so your Meta zones, you can insult people without realizing you via your medicine.\nit's nobody uses that word. Andrew Ippolito: You wild medicine wild Adam anyway, man is Oh, and I don't know why we call it that.\nAndrew Ippolito: zone zoo and go to the zoo to see animals, reduce oh and do yeah and then you have the plants plan day.\nAndrew Ippolito: As the formal name and then you have. Andrew Ippolito: A really fun people, the young guys, these are the multicellular that's the key, these are multicellular This is where all the tissues tissues right and you would say they acquire the trade Maltese sell you Larry the kingdom multicellular charities specialization.\nAndrew Ippolito: specialization of function, we have different types of cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you are not multicellular if all of your cells are the same, they all do the same thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: Now earth's environment changes, sometimes dramatically quickly, but most of the time it's just a slow change.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so every single time a population has another generation and another generation and older generation.\nAndrew Ippolito: As the earth slowly changes those populations have to slowly change, so you can think of evolution as a synchronization and clocks between the rate of change of the environment and the rate of change of the genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if those if that synchronization gets ripped apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like during some kind of gigantic of men. Andrew Ippolito: Like a meteor strike or a global fire.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then things go extinct they can't change fast enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it turns out. Andrew Ippolito: Sexual reproduction evolved.\nAndrew Ippolito: to balance two things to balance the idea that a multicellular organisms needs to have its genome stay the same, because multicellular clarity requires a whole layer really multiple layers of complexity of regulation and balance that a single cell organism doesn't need to worry about.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it has to have a very stable genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: meaning, it does not change know mutations and if something does mistakenly happen, we kill it without produce.\nAndrew Ippolito: or fire right OK. Andrew Ippolito: And then, so you can see, cancer is when something goes wrong and we get an unstable GMO.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, one of the hallmarks of cancer is genomic instability, instead of every cell dividing and having almost no differences in the next generation.\nAndrew Ippolito: unstable genomes will give rise to hundreds of differences that's what causes cancer to rapidly progressing involve the resistance is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, so, on the other side of the fence right so so this would be the individual, and let me get her on here so individuals have stable genomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the question then is they go, how do I make sure the next generation has a completely different genome their mind if I need my genome, to be stable and that's where the specialization comes in the sex sells right sex, sexual reproduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the hedging of the beds, to make sure that the next generation is different.\nAndrew Ippolito: And each of the three lineages have taken this and done a little bit of a different take to it, based on the way they live their life.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's how i'm going, I want to teach you how it works now so so tori I show it's great that you asked that question because we're gonna have to see this and into and everywhere here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so here here's what i'm gonna do for you i'm going to instead of just like showing you all that noise at once, when I give it to you slowly here you got.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to start with an adult. Andrew Ippolito: Here is my artistic representation of the adult female.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here. Andrew Ippolito: will be the adult male.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have somatic cells right. Andrew Ippolito: Their body cells, we see that there to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the key here this so this this might sound like a not nothing burger, but this is the key one key point there multicellular state is deployed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Multi cellular. State.\nis deployed. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, in other words, their tissues, they have tissues in this stage of their life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, they each generate what's called a ganymede.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so gamma isn't is the formal name for for generic SEC sell gamma gamma.\nAndrew Ippolito: gamma through always have blood.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a big. Andrew Ippolito: there's.\nAndrew Ippolito: The key here is, these are.\nAndrew Ippolito: musicians, let me use the right word here unicellular.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so for animals there multicellular state is deployed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Their gametes are happy, but there's unicellular status halfway.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right those egg sells a mature egg so or a mature sperm cell, they are what you would call you know let's write this down there called terminally differentiated meaning they will never go through mitosis again.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's the end of the line for them there's no mitosis that an happily egg several ever go through there's no mitosis that a mature sperm cell will ever go through these are terminally differentiate they are a my topic.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then. Andrew Ippolito: What happens.\nAndrew Ippolito: Without going into too much detail here. Andrew Ippolito: We have something called single me.\nAndrew Ippolito: The fusion event. Andrew Ippolito: And we get what's called a zygote.\nAndrew Ippolito: zygote is unicellular. Andrew Ippolito: But it is to end.\nAndrew Ippolito: It is deploy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then from there, we go through growth in differentiation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we get.

Andrew Ippolito: I just read an article yesterday they're shutting down Yahoo answers.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah for the day, which has been around for 16 years and it's been a cesspool of misinformation.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, but how are babby forum that was one of the best means when I was, I still remember when it first hit it was I was like there's this one guy who took that whole thread and read it and narrated it and oh my God, I was just crying.\nAndrew Ippolito: or he i'm sorry no he didn't he didn't read that thread he he went through Yahoo answers or or Yahoo questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he pulled out all the questions that were like that that had the word pregnant in it pertinent per go paragon in the US, and he was just narrating the monster funny so funny anyway, so this is how bad it is formed.\nAndrew Ippolito: and stick figure form, without any details.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So if we zoom out here, you can see.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's let's just think about that so multicellular deployed. Andrew Ippolito: unicellular halfway that's, the key to the mountain.\nAndrew Ippolito: met his own life cycle is the multicellular is deployed the units others happy, but that's the key Okay, we never, never, never, never have happily cell going through.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anything it doesn't go through a cell cycle it's just there and then they immediately have that single me happen okay so by understanding that pattern, you can immediately understand the pattern of the fungus now the fungus is all of this, except switch the handle it and the dip what.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so watch this let's do fungus now.\nAndrew Ippolito: So an adult fungus. Andrew Ippolito: looks like a web of tubes.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the stick figure version of a fungus. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, this is called the mycelium.\nAndrew Ippolito: I seen that word before notice I didn't draw.\nAndrew Ippolito: A mushroom. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, a mushroom is basically the the sex organ.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's where that is a, that is, the reproductive or organism organism oh my God the reproductive organs.\nTaylor Campbell: Okay, so um my Sam, how do you say. Andrew Ippolito: So the mycelium is happy, so this is multicellular.\nTaylor Campbell: Is that, like the body cells. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah yeah yeah, this is the. Andrew Ippolito: This is the somatic tissue.\nAndrew Ippolito: It is multicellular it is halfway. Andrew Ippolito: and\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Welcome to something completely different than us.\nAndrew Ippolito: People who study this are called my colleges. Andrew Ippolito: This is my college.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're college. My guys. Angela Harbeck: I thought you said that i'm halfway or uni salyer are good I just.\nAndrew Ippolito: For for Meta zones. Angela Harbeck: So it's different. Andrew Ippolito: Exactly that's the inside, I want you to walk away with here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have we're learning three life cycles, we just learned them at his own life. Andrew Ippolito: cycle that's when you grow up with everybody's familiar with that one I did that was what I just did up there was like me.\nAndrew Ippolito: explaining the sky is blue and water is wet right that's it we it's part of who we are, we understand that our cells are deployed and our anchor half floyd or spurs half blood thinner sign closer to play so now here's something completely different that's like aliens.\nAndrew Ippolito: The adult fungus. Andrew Ippolito: is happily. Andrew Ippolito: This is going to be a very important characteristic when we learn about beetle empty them later beetle and tatum worked on a bread mold and prosper across.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they induced mutations within them to try to understand, to understand how genes work, what a gene represents and.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason they selected bread mold was it easy to grow, but more importantly being halfway, it means that you only have one copy of all of your genes which means if there's a mutation and one of them you're going to affect something.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, whereas if you have a backup copy and only one gets mutated chances are you're not going to see any difference there that's like a recessive trait so you use halfway cells, when you want to study genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so. Andrew Ippolito: there's mom and dad.\nAndrew Ippolito: They produce, and let me see if I can do this without. Andrew Ippolito: i'm gonna i'm gonna look I because I don't have this burned into my head nearly as well.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah Okay, these will go through not meiosis but mitosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they will produce a unicellular. Andrew Ippolito: When I call this we're gonna call this Academy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to just come back here again yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah it's literally everything's the same except.\nAndrew Ippolito: The end of the 200. Andrew Ippolito: swap So these are still at.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So that that's kind of a difference is they they're unicellular gametes are of the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: copy number, you know there's still an there's still happen, but then what's going to happen as a sink me occurs between these two got means.\nAndrew Ippolito: So again, you have sync to me. Andrew Ippolito: And you get as I go.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that zygote is to end it is unicellular.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that zygote does not. Andrew Ippolito: become multicellular it immediately goes into meiosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you get these are called. Andrew Ippolito: they're not going to go into the details in this slide these are spores.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what a sport is ready, the word spore you've seen this word your whole life you never really knew what it meant a spore is a single cell that has the ability to become a multicellular adult without the need for fertilization.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so these are all happy.\nAndrew Ippolito: This would be called spore relation but you'll learn that next semester. Andrew Ippolito: And so, then the cells basically.\nAndrew Ippolito: become. multicellular.\nVictoria Bloemker: Do you mind repeating the definition for sport. Victoria Bloemker: A spore is.\nAndrew Ippolito: A single cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: will say with. Andrew Ippolito: The capacity.\nAndrew Ippolito: to become. Andrew Ippolito: A Maltese cellular adult.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you could say i'm prophecies without. Andrew Ippolito: The need.\nAndrew Ippolito: For fertilization.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, our air is filled with spores spores are everywhere that's why you can't go to the store buy a loaf of bread come home open it take a piece of bread out put in your refrigerator and then wait for a little while and not have bread built for.\nAndrew Ippolito: The dust in the air around you right, not your breathing is in right now there are spores everywhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every surface is coated with them and they're generally enter unless they're given the conditions to grow go ahead alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: Is the zygote the sport, then. Andrew Ippolito: know. Andrew Ippolito: The zygote is the zygote and the zygote is to N and the zygote goes through meiosis to create the half point sports.\nAlexis Micewski: So for the beginning when it goes through mitosis instead of meiosis, is there not as much like genetic variation there because of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: well.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay that's it's a fundamentally different class.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's all i'll say about Chapter 13 so more questions i'm fine with more questions I don't have any new material for this and we're going to get to genetics."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 12 (Part 3) - Meiosis and Sexual Life Cycles","link":"https://youtu.be/9yMBF08YiLc?si=GjLZRIlIFQ6rkgZs","chunkTitle":"Conclusion of Chapter 13","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito concludes the lecture on Chapter 13, highlighting the diversity of life and the focus on understanding the differences between organisms.","start":"43:18","end":"43:27","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And that's all i'll say about Chapter 13 so more questions i'm fine with more questions I don't have any new material for this and we're going to get to genetics.\nAlexa Deprisco: One last thing about that so yeah.

Andrew Ippolito: So, first of all.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to go back in time in your imagination to like pre 1800s and think about the way humans raised animals, think about horses and pigs and cows and sheep hundreds of years ago, thousands of years ago.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and imagine we took two animals and.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we took a.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's take pigs pigs in the Middle Ages were were pretty thin animals, they weren't the huge pigs, we have today.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, by then, if you took a a medium to medium size pigs. Andrew Ippolito: You put them together, you get a medium sized pig if you produce guinea pigs together, you get too skinny pigs, if you take a medium sized pig and a skinny pig you would get you know something in the middle, the idea here is that when you took animals and plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you had them go through sexual reproduction, the offspring seem to be a blending of the two parents and so it's called blending.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of the way you you plan paints right you take a little bit of you know, yellow and a little bit of blue and mushroom together and get green right yellow blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so if you think about that. Andrew Ippolito: don't take some yellow and take some blue, and those are paints, we would see some green pop out of that right.\nAndrew Ippolito: No now imagine, though, we took so let's get some green now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we were able to make some green. Andrew Ippolito: there's nothing we can do with that green.\nAndrew Ippolito: To bring it back. To. Andrew Ippolito: separate them again right, we can never separate those out again right once you got green that's it forever.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or take some coffee you got hot black coffee and cold milk.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so let's say you had some coffee here and some milk here, and you had an empty cup right here, and you pour it half the coffee in here and half the milk in there, and you get Beige lukewarm liquid.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's nothing we can do with that liquid there's no amount of pouring that will ever give us black coffee again or white milk again.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So, even though we saw things blending over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Occasionally we would see offspring that presented with the same appearance as their grandparents alright, so the ridiculous example would be take take a fat pig.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a skinny guinea pig.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and have babies and the babies are like medium sized pig.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then take to medium sized pigs.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you would think the offspring would all be medium sized. Andrew Ippolito: But sometimes.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll get the fat pig just like grandpa was or this guinea pig just like grandma was.\nAndrew Ippolito: and other words you would see the occasional.\nAndrew Ippolito: reoccurrence of. Andrew Ippolito: Parental traits.\nAndrew Ippolito: And back then there weren't any scientists, these are horse breeders, these were these were farmers, these were just normal everyday people no nobody's doing experiments, they just would hand wave it away.\nAndrew Ippolito: Something something about their the heritable material was unstable.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which couldn't have been further from the truth, but that's how they saw it. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so.\nAndrew Ippolito: For thousands of years humans. Andrew Ippolito: accepted inheritance as a blending we are all the blends of our mom and dad, you have the eyes of your mom and the hair of your dad and the skin tone of your mom and there's like we're just we're amalgams of the brain that that's how we tend to see things."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 1) - Introduction to Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/UHM1lJTu5PE?si=TbxLXWc-edh9i1hY","chunkTitle":"The Problem with Blending Theory","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the limitations of blending theory and its implications for understanding inheritance.","start":"6:18","end":"10:49","content":"Andrew Ippolito: For thousands of years humans.

Andrew Ippolito: If the parents always the last spring, that are blending of the two then as time goes forward all traits are going to just even out we're never going to see diversity right yeah I have.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah there's slides here that I want to show you that I don't have so like I have a slide on blending theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: I know where it is or the other class hold on just give me two seconds here. Andrew Ippolito: One on one lectures and.\narchive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright it's kind of hard to see because of the background, can you see that a little bit so here you have four for individually for.\nAndrew Ippolito: For couples and white flowers flowers and you can see that. Andrew Ippolito: The white flower the flower give rise to varying shades of pink right, but over time, each generation right so like these to get together and.\nA whole lot I mean.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let me take a screenshot of the wall, with the white background it's just easier to see that's that's a transparent image, but.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So here, you can see that the offspring of this first.\nAndrew Ippolito: group gives you the right they had three kids varying shades of pink right.\nAndrew Ippolito: These young you have white and red and pink so all these variations, but then the next generation right so generation zero we're really generation, one that we're here let's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Start calling these things by the rightful name, so this would be the parental generation. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, they have the first Filial generation will collect the F1 Filial Filial means siblings.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's the first sibling generation and then.\nAndrew Ippolito: We take two individuals from that generation and they made, and so this right here would be that would be the F2 generation right, and then you can see, by the F3 generation, all of them are pink.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is how blending would work if this was true. Andrew Ippolito: and clearly over time we maintain diversity in our population right, I mean we still all look different, despite the fact that we're thousands of generations into being humans.\nAndrew Ippolito: So blending can't be true.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words the theory doesn't fit the data right."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 1) - Introduction to Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/UHM1lJTu5PE?si=TbxLXWc-edh9i1hY","chunkTitle":"Mendel's Experiments with Pea Plants","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains Mendel's experiments with pea plants and the concept of hybridization.","start":"10:49","end":"33:17","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So, in other words the theory doesn't fit the data right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this actually turned out to be a huge problem when Darwin was starting to put things together, because he did not have.\nAndrew Ippolito: A. Andrew Ippolito: scientific basis for heredity.\nAndrew Ippolito: which was needed for understanding evolution right blending theory did not fit Darwin.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there was no genetic theory for darwin's work he came up with an idea called pan genesis which was very ridiculous and not true.\nAndrew Ippolito: So combine this with the fact that most people believed that species were fixed in time and did not change, you had a very highly debatable theory evolution theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the question is, is how did new forms arise if there was no variation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And Darren made up this idea, you can read about it just take Darwin genetics concept pan genesis and you can read about how he saw miniature people and sperm basically for like little little tiny among July in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now in science, we talked about these ideas of scientific revolutions.\nAndrew Ippolito: We all believe one thing there's like a consensus and then somebody comes along and says we're all wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the burden of proof isn't on the majority of the population, the one person can't be like you're all wrong and we're like Oh, I guess that's it folks.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the crazy person coming in with their wild ideas they're the ones that have to prove their case, and if they can't, then the consensus doesn't change over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and breeders horse breeders and pigeon breeders and dog breeders and whatnot they did see blending.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason for that is it turns out most of our treats are complicated there's more than one gene and there's more than one on Leal called poly genetic inheritance.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, there are some traits that aren't though they're just rare, because as i've said this a couple times now, these are complicated.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so. Andrew Ippolito: i'm going to i'm going to skip ahead i'm focusing too much time here think I think about all the outmoded theories we've had over over the course of human civilization right the flat earth and the earth flat everybody believed that and some crazy person comes along says no it's round.\nAndrew Ippolito: or approve it, so the you know the tikka tikka stick in some geometry, and they show the circumference of the earth, which shadows and if you guys know about how that works, basically, if you if you if you're standing in the northern hemisphere.\nAndrew Ippolito: You take a big long stick and you put it up at the exact same you know the High Noon on April 7 and the sun cast a shadow on the ground, you can use trigonometry to calculate the length of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can solve for X there. Andrew Ippolito: And then you walk down here, and you do the exact same measurements and the sun's in a different place because you're on a curved surface.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then basically use math and you can estimate the circumference of the earth and they came within 10% error which isn't too bad for a stick and some math.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a lot of persistence. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And how about you know the sun goes around the earth wait no it doesn't prove it, and then some astronomy in some math some.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's see right, so the idea here is that when when humanity believes a and somebody comes along with be the person who's saying be has to show that be is better than, not the other way around.\nAndrew Ippolito: offspring, are a blend of their parents. Andrew Ippolito: Well, how do you explain recurring parental treats.\nAndrew Ippolito: The instability of their hereditary material.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, I think, ready, I think there are discrete factors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, not the blending of treats. Andrew Ippolito: In other words, you can think of this as what's the word what's the word.\nAndrew Ippolito: file there's a word that I can't hold out of my head right now particulate This is called the articulate model.\nAndrew Ippolito: of inheritance. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's the opposite of the blending model blending would say that you think just blur together the particular model says that there are these discrete factors and, to this day, we call them mendel's factors this idea of the factor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the hunt for those in the early 20th century they talked about mendel's factors all the time in their papers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so he proposed a particular model of inheritance.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then prove it. Andrew Ippolito: So this this dude here Mendel Gregor Mendel.\nAndrew Ippolito: was born in Austria, Hungary to poor parents. Andrew Ippolito: They recognize his brilliance at a young age.\nAndrew Ippolito: He eventually. Andrew Ippolito: went to university and then he opted to join the church because because he was really poor that that's what it came down to he couldn't afford.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean they couldn't afford food they were like third generation farmers in a not so well off place and i'm cutting a lot of corners in the story just to get to the gist of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can just type go to Wikipedia me Greg mendel's entry if you're interested in the history of that stuff is he's got a really interesting life but here's the cool thing the.\nAndrew Ippolito: The Catholic Church back in the 1800s was put in charge of the education system in Austria, Hungary in that area of the of the world is that that is now actually now it's the Czech Republic and hungry, I think that the politics, the politics of area have always been.\nAndrew Ippolito: in flux and so. Andrew Ippolito: monasteries and monks live solitary lives abbott's and abby's are the PR branch of the church and they're the ones that are engaged with the public.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so Mendel joined this abby that happened to have a reputation of being kind of a free thinking radical scientifically friendly place and essentially he lived in a.\nAndrew Ippolito: bit here with a bunch of other guys and it was kind of like a frat house for science, they were just allowed to dabble in their experiments and play.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, and they were also he also had to teach. Andrew Ippolito: And there was this one fun story, where he would walk around as classroom with a pocket full of dried piece, which is what he was doing experiments with and it's just students that were falling asleep, he would flip piece that them to wake them up.\nAndrew Ippolito: So he wasn't even that interested in genetics, he was interested in all the complicated stuff he loved weather and actually one of his mentor's was a guy named doppler you've all heard the doppler effect i'm sure or her doppler radar doppler was the one that came up with the.\nAndrew Ippolito: He he studied whether i'll just leave it at that and so Mendel loved the chaos and complexity of the universe, and, unfortunately, he was he was too far ahead of his time.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's kind of like today there's people who get all excited about you know alien life, they want to be Dino biologists and study alien microbes and we don't have any of those right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: So people who is you know biologists all that works theoretical right they were born like 200 years too early to do that kind of work or maybe not.\nAndrew Ippolito: But you get the idea so Mendel was born in this period time where the math wasn't even invented yet statistics statistics as a math wasn't even invented at this point and a lot of his work really needed some good statistical ideas.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is why his ideas died with him for a couple of decades Mendel died in the 1860s 1880s 1860s.\nAndrew Ippolito: and his work was rediscovered in 1901 by a group of data, there was like a Danish scientist or a Norwegian or something and they um.\nAndrew Ippolito: They had done their work and they just were doing like a literature search just to see if anybody else came upon this stuff before and Sure enough, they uncovered all of his work and they're like oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: whoops we got scooped 40 years ago that would be like somebody's going to the library today and unearthing some documents that showed how advanced artificial intelligence works.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then they were just so far ahead of their time nobody understood what they were doing and it collected dust in the bottom of some library.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this this guy was a genius. Andrew Ippolito: And he made a lot of advances and in several areas, and eventually became an administrator at the Abbey and he ran the place and stop doing science.\nAndrew Ippolito: So his contribution was this idea of particular inheritance and he really his laws he's he has these two fundamental laws will learn about they they serve as the basis for all modern genetics, so we call Mendel the father of genetics he's he's the one that started the science of genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so when it says discrete factor that you're talking about dnr trees, rather than blending.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's dnr tori. Victoria Bloemker: Like dominant and recessive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh yeah yeah we're we're really we're talking about a liam's number we've learned this concept already great for one gene we each have a parable deals, so the illegal.\nAndrew Ippolito: would be the factor. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, you could even argue that the chromosome is a factor right the chromosome is a chunk that gets inherited to and, in fact, in the late 1800s when people were starting to study and see under the microscope meiosis mitosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's when they started making the connections right mendel's first law well we'll get there alright, so what he did, to show off his work was he used normal ordinary garden.\nAndrew Ippolito: garden piece, where you should grow, they were able to self fertilize they were able to be controlled in their fertilization and, naturally, there were lots of different varieties, all you had to do was go down the road to pound and there was a guy there, called the.\nAndrew Ippolito: They call them the seed man and he sold seeds of various types of crop seeds for farming and so he they had different bright of the piece, and so he would collect a few of those and use those in those experiments.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so he did and Mendel did extraordinarily method.\nAndrew Ippolito: meticulous accurate experiments that's what made this possible when you guys ultimately go and do some lab work in some future class or as a job.\nAndrew Ippolito: The hardest thing, in my opinion, really when it comes to being experimentalists is to be able to be methodical, to the point where your your brain is screeching at the boredom of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like Imagine going to the supermarket and buying 20 bags of m&ms.\nAndrew Ippolito: dumping them all into a bin and then counting the number of yellow vs blue versus Brown and tabulating all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's torture. Andrew Ippolito: that's sometimes the kind of thing you have to do to do good science.\nAndrew Ippolito: and mental did that. Andrew Ippolito: Right so i'm gonna give you so, by the way, that's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why, I took this picture, when I went to the museum, once this is mendel's copy of darwin's book.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so there's this really good story here that if Darwin and Mendel met each other and compared notes and Darwin was able to learn what Mendel discovered in us what Mendel had we could have advanced the science behind.\nAndrew Ippolito: molecular genetics and evolution by decades.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's not how science works right, and so this book, if you look carefully here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, these two pencil marks right here so so Mendel put these two scratches here and then next to that you can't really see it as an exclamation mark.\nAndrew Ippolito: In German, I don't anybody here speak German, I had one student try to translate for this one's This basically this little passage here, this is so, this is the German translation of darwin's English and mental spoke German obviously.\nAndrew Ippolito: This talks about darwin's need for a particular model of inheritance.\nAndrew Ippolito: And mentos like I have it. Andrew Ippolito: So that's why he got all excited when Mendel finished his work, and he was he was.\nAndrew Ippolito: The title of his work was very bottom of the hybridization and plants plant hybridization he sent copies of his work to the world's greatest scientists at the time, like 20 copies to 20 people and one of those people was Darwin.\nAndrew Ippolito: And after Darwin died, and they were cleaning out his stuff they did find mendel's work on his desk but to this day, we don't know if Darwin ever read it.\nAndrew Ippolito: We do know that Darwin hated math and that he's so Darwin wrote a lot, he has a lot of letters and diaries and journals and books, and so we know Darwin as a person very well, and we know that Darwin didn't like math and he's famous for saying something to paraphrase.\nAndrew Ippolito: math is useless for biology. Andrew Ippolito: One of my sayings, which I kind of like I started think along the same lines Darwin didn't one of my things is biology is the science for people who are bad at math.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I say that jokingly but really if you think of like physics and chemistry, you need to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're doing all math all the time and those things right, for the most part and science and biology, you can get away with not doing math and a lot of disciplines there's only a few that really require hardcore math.\nAndrew Ippolito: So my guess is Darwin wasn't very good at math and that's why he hated it and so when he saw mendel's original work and he started flipping through it, he saw lots of math in there, he probably went i'll read that later.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: here's an anatomy of the p plan, this is what Darwin i'm sorry this don't put a domino this what mental work with though here's the way this plant works so it's hermaphroditic it has both male female parts.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the green the green chunk here, everything is green in this picture is female and yellow is now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, the male part the simpler part here, you know the filament and at the top of the filament is this thing called the answer, the answer is what provides the pollen the little yellow pollen Greens you'll see collectively this thing is called this statement.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: The Green the whole big long green thing is called the carpool right so plants so flowers have the carpool on the state.\nAndrew Ippolito: The carpool has, at the very tippy top of it, the sticky area, called the stigma the sticky stigma the stigma, is where the policy is would attach.\nTaylor Campbell: The length if sorry. Andrew Ippolito: Go ahead. Taylor Campbell: Is this only flowering plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: do so yeah, this is the anatomy of all like this is the universal concept, the flowers. Andrew Ippolito: Have there's. Andrew Ippolito: tons of variation here, not all some flowers or mouse i'm a female, this is a male female flower, this is a hermaphrodite but they all have the same basic parts, so a male flower would just have the filament and.\nAndrew Ippolito: A female or just have the carpool the parts are all the same there's always a stigma style and ovary.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the stigmas the sticky part the styles, the shaft and then the ovary is the basically the womb it's the Chamber that has all the individual eggs in it so each one of these dots represents an individual.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's The other reason, this is such a powerful tool to use, you can have off, you can have multiple offspring all at once alright, so the idea here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the pollen will fertilized here, it will migrate down, and it will cause fertilization events to occur, and then you would see the maturation within the people so each one of these individuals is genetically distinct.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, each one of those has its own individual. Andrew Ippolito: So what he would do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is he would isolate some. Andrew Ippolito: some useful strain of the plant and he could make females by just cutting off the filaments with a pair of scissors and so now you knew, you know that any fertilization event that occurs is something you control.\nAndrew Ippolito: It can't solve policy. Andrew Ippolito: So what you would do is you would what he did he would isolate different colonies of these plants and hold on a second if something stuck in my throat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Normal water here. I blow.\nAndrew Ippolito: glass with your coffee okay. Andrew Ippolito: We have the ability to take a paintbrush we're just taking ordinary paintbrush and he would go to the mail and he would get some pollen and he will go to the female and he would pawnee Okay, this was the act of this this was called hybridization.\nAndrew Ippolito: or cross pollination.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and instead of saying male and female, we would say the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let me think of the words what would be.\nAndrew Ippolito: The pollen in the seed. Andrew Ippolito: So if the pollen donor and this you donor.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll say male female but just keep in mind like that's the idea, the female will have this seat and the melody.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so if you had a particular treat. Andrew Ippolito: You would have two sets of crosses you would have one set let's say that you were looking at pea color which will will do first all right, if we were doing pea color we would say that the seed donor would be yellow and the pollen donor would be green.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then we would do a separate set. Andrew Ippolito: Where the seed donor was green and the pollen donor was yellow you see that that's called a reciprocal cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that the genders, or the sexes are swapped for the given trait that they're studying.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, reciprocal. Andrew Ippolito: Cross there's a few named crosses that you're going to need to know that's the first OK so again i'll reciprocal crosses a pair of crosses where the sexes are swapped for the for whatever traits we're talking about.\nAndrew Ippolito: So moms yellow and dads green and then also dad's green a mom's yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and what this was was this was his way of eliminating the possibility of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Any patterns, he saw being related to the sexes, of the planets.\nAlexis Micewski: Can you repeat the definition for reciprocal ground sorry. Andrew Ippolito: it's okay. Andrew Ippolito: it's where the sexes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are. Andrew Ippolito: swap for the traits of interest.\nTaylor Campbell: So is that, like that picture, where he cut away the answer's. Andrew Ippolito: No, this is me just teaching you.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah no i'll here's the here's the thing guys, but I just i'm trying to teach you too much on one slide. Andrew Ippolito: So let me, let me skip ahead here, well, eventually, this will all make sense, once we do the details of it, so this was the think of this as the.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the model organism he used to study the basics of genetics. Andrew Ippolito: And there there's a picture of him in his his buddies and I imagine like Gregor put down that P and pay attention right do you see.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which one of those people would have to be mental he he was I like to think mental was either use either ADHD or asperger's or whatever he was always in his own little world and, like super smart so.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is it's not a P it's fuchsia to spring a fish.\nTaylor Campbell: way more time let's see the one that was a monk, who yes.\nAndrew Ippolito: texting. Taylor Campbell: He was an Abbot but yeah. Andrew Ippolito: They call a month. Andrew Ippolito: There wasn't a monastery that's the key there it wasn't a solitary confinement setup it was a social setup.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, here it is peace September them so to them. Andrew Ippolito: it's a Harry Potter spell piece some cities.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like that anyway so um. Andrew Ippolito: So they're normally self fertilizing Okay, so you have self fertilization, and you have cross fertilization, you have to be able to distinguish those things, so you can do a self cross, and you can do a hybridization.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now don't look at the numbers here just listen to my words when you're looking at this over here we're talking about individual traits that he investigated."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 1) - Introduction to Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/UHM1lJTu5PE?si=TbxLXWc-edh9i1hY","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Genetics","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the topic of genetics and explains the significance of studying traits in plants.

Andrew Ippolito: The key here that so he selected these traits because, when he looked at the way plants reproduce he found that these traits always had two different modes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there were yellow piece or there were a green peas, there are tall plans or there were short plans.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, there were inflated or constricted rounder wrinkled Axial versus terminal flowers purple flowers white flowers green carpools or yellow carpools or particular okay so to just like we have an ear lobe that is either attached or detached there's no nothing in between.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all or nothing yellow or green and and.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of those traits was dominant over the other and i'll explain what that means in a bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay don't worry about the math just yet don't worry about any of this just the idea of the traits and the fact that there's two.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now i'm going to wait for this for you. Andrew Ippolito: This is my most of my students prefer at this point to be doing this on the whiteboard so i'm going to teach you genetics here.\nTo white.

He introduces the idea of dominant and recessive traits and demonstrates how to use Punnett squares to predict offspring phenotypes.","start":"42:20","end":"57:03","content":"Andrew Ippolito: break reminding me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you guys there.\nAndrew Ippolito: water.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so put your algebra caps on a little bit. Andrew Ippolito: Work that we're going to learn here, this is, this is the one part of this class that's really skill based, as well as conceptual so doing genetics problems is a thing i'm going to teach you how to do this stuff so the terminology, the techniques, the patterns of thinking, all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: alright. Andrew Ippolito: So the first thing is, we have to establish what are called.\nAndrew Ippolito: Through breeding. Andrew Ippolito: True breeding individuals, the idea of true breeding.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is that hairless use green as an example here. Andrew Ippolito: So here's a plant that gives Greenpeace and here's a plan that gives yellow piece.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll show you just the way my brain works, I want to put these yellow comes first okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the idea is if this plant is allowed to self pollinate and provide offspring, the offspring will always have.\nAndrew Ippolito: 100% yellow. Andrew Ippolito: And if these are allowed to self pollinate they will always 100% of the time have green.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so we would say that yellow.\nGreen. Andrew Ippolito: Are the two phenotypes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So phenotype means the outward appearance of the treat right so like my brown hair would be my phenotype for hair color.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: don't worry about you know because again we're looking at visible patterns of inheritance.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so mental establishes takes them two years to establish these true breeding offspring.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, he needs he makes absolutely sure that all the offspring of any of these always has exactly the same field.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's, not a single green pea in the yellows and not single yellow and then. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, then what he does it does this pair of reciprocal crosses he takes.\nAndrew Ippolito: A yellow pea. Andrew Ippolito: That is female.\nAndrew Ippolito: or he takes a green pea. Andrew Ippolito: Best female.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then he cross pollinate or he hybridize it with the opposite.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, this would be a pollen donor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and he looks at the offspring so we're gonna call this generation here this generation here this level of generation, this is the p generation no pun intended.\nAnd this is the parental generation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now here's, the first thing your brain is going to start to fight and get confused about is, I want to try to clarify it right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which generations, the p generation right, I mean those pieces came from another generation and another generation other judges So where do we draw the line you draw the line i'm taking these two peas i'm going to call these the perennials and they're going to have offspring.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: In a classic so we're establishing a classic cross here and i'll tell you what it was the name of it is in a second, but so here's The next thing I want to tell you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember that these are sexually reproducing organisms rate those adults, will give us gametes so i'm just just for now i'm just gonna be like remember there's there's a gamut here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then they're singing me number sinking me comes together and they produce an offspring, and it just so happens that when Mendel did this work he got a yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: set. Andrew Ippolito: Of. Andrew Ippolito: philly the first Filial generation was 100% yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he saw this. Andrew Ippolito: Regardless of what the gender was.\nWhat the sex was.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So he immediately empirically remember that word empirical empirical means you see it with your own two eyes, he empirically demonstrated that yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Was dominant. Andrew Ippolito: And therefore, green.\nIs recessive. Andrew Ippolito: In other words, Greens hiding there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's the first test of the funding model if we allow this P to self pollinate.\nAndrew Ippolito: If we allow the F one generation to pollen self pollinate.\nAndrew Ippolito: and give us offspring.\nAndrew Ippolito: And again remember you know there's there's two gap means there they come together to form an individual, it turns out that in that F two generations.\nAndrew Ippolito: He can make a prediction if they were all yellow and he never saw green again.\nAndrew Ippolito: We could say that that supported the blending theory of inheritance.\nAndrew Ippolito: If, instead, he saw some green in there. Andrew Ippolito: That would completely defeat the blending model that would show that there is a particular model that is more accurate and Sure enough, not only did he see green, but he saw always in the same ratio for every three yellows.\nAndrew Ippolito: He would find a single green pea.\nAndrew Ippolito: always there were always three yellows to one green, and so we would say this.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would see the phenotypic ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, 321. yellow to green.\nAndrew Ippolito: So he didn't sometimes see two to one and sometimes 421 he always saw 321.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that right there that's when you know you're onto something. Andrew Ippolito: One of my favorite quotes that i've come across about science itself is and I don't know who said this i'm sure we can look it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Doing science is like having a quiet conversation with nature, you ask nature, a question, and if you ask it right nature gives you an answer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: What happens if I cross the yellow F1 to itself, you get 321.\nAndrew Ippolito: Nature answered, but why what man nature doesn't give up at secrets that easily you got to think about right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So he did Ray so he did this this idea here of the F tues showing the reemergence of the recessive trait.\nAndrew Ippolito: He saw this over and over again for those different selected. Andrew Ippolito: If we go back to the slide here, he saw that pattern, and all of these so look at the numbers now look at the right hand side of the screen here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is what I meant about counting m&ms Okay, he counted 8023 piece.\nAndrew Ippolito: He counted, so he did this, so you can imagine he's got a greenhouse where he did all this there's dozens of plants, he collected thousands of peas.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then he counted them. Andrew Ippolito: And he counted 6022 yellow piece and.\nAndrew Ippolito: Greenpeace. Andrew Ippolito: Right and what did that ratio six to two.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and reduce that 321. Andrew Ippolito: And if you pulled your calculator out and you did that, for every single one of these things you would see that exact same ratio of 321321321321 every time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So that told him that there was some secret rule here, there was a hidden rule of nature that he just uncovered.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, he went to the drawing board and he said this, this is how we rationalized It is like all right, we got two parents.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we got the female we got the MIC Now we have this F1 whatever this offspring is.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say. Andrew Ippolito: that each one of the parents is contributing some particle some discrete factor to the offspring.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the offspring has has to have these factors right so so the individual.\nAndrew Ippolito: donate one. Andrew Ippolito: And then the offspring has to so that also means that the parents have to.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are just like slots. Andrew Ippolito: Empty slots right so let's let's give this makeup some some window here so because yellow is dominant the green let's let this trait be represented me get myself i'm going to get rid of the slots now you'll see i'm gonna write real letters here let's say that.\nAndrew Ippolito: We represent this trade with a capital y signifying yellow and lowercase y signifying green.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that so so now you're learning the math of genetics, at least from Indian genetics, the idea is if the letter.\nAndrew Ippolito: is taken. Andrew Ippolito: From the dominant tree.\nAndrew Ippolito: So never use a lowercase G for green that's that's a no no there's no G in this there's yellow or there's there's a white capital a lowercase one, so the idea is is one parent donates a capital y and the other donates a lowercase y so that the individual offspring has one of each.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that, for whatever reason, this combination gives us yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And because this one here was a true Member she was true breeding they always provided.\nAndrew Ippolito: me they always provide a DEMO so it makes sense that they have.\nAndrew Ippolito: To capital wise and because this one's Green, you get to lowercase wise.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, just just using logic, at this point, this, this is an has to be that way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so individuals have two factors for a given trade.\nAndrew Ippolito: When they develop their gametes their gametes only have one factor and those two factors come back together on the offspring, that has to treats.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when he mapped this out this made perfect sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, he called ready, if I have two. Andrew Ippolito: factors that are the same, whether it's to capital wise or two lowercase wise this state is being called homozygous.\nAndrew Ippolito: homo saying. like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, because. Andrew Ippolito: The to capital wise get present us with the dominant phenotype we would call this homozygous dominant.\nAnd this would be homozygous. recessive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the parental generation had these.\nAndrew Ippolito: In this experiment that doesn't mean all parental generations have to be homozygous.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the F1 gave us one of each rate one of each year, we would call this heterozygous.\nAndrew Ippolito: or heterozygous and we turn these the genome types.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you, you would never use the plain English words yellow and green when you're talking about the genome types, you would say homozygous heterozygous versus.\nAndrew Ippolito: This work oh go ahead alyssa.\nAndrew Ippolito: For a heterozygous geno's hype you wouldn't have to say dominant and recessive exactly it's like one of each yeah so saying heterozygous dominant or heterozygous recessive would be there just be wrong.\nyeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: This work did two things it destroyed blending as a as a theory."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 1) - Introduction to Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/UHM1lJTu5PE?si=TbxLXWc-edh9i1hY","chunkTitle":"Mendel's First Law: Law of Segregation","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses Mendel's first law, the law of segregation.

Andrew Ippolito: of segregation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the last segregation simply states. Andrew Ippolito: That and i'm going to write all this, I have a slide I don't want to hand write it off me just get over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: period OK, for each treat for a given treat, there are two factors present and individual.\nAndrew Ippolito: This goes right along with the idea of somatic cells being deployed right so like we learned all the the reality of all this, and now we're learning about how we got there so we're sort of putting the cart before the horse.\nAndrew Ippolito: So earlier today when it when Tony asked about to end and then this is exactly what we're talking about okay so adults are to win.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then these factors separate drink mutagenesis these factors separate when got me Sir formed they become in halfway.\nAndrew Ippolito: gametes themselves only have a factor for a tree one factor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the galleries come together again fertilization single me the new individual has two factors ago.\nAndrew Ippolito: So really we already knew all this from doing meiosis mitosis so we could say the sky is blue, this is not there's nothing new here, this is just us formally stating something you already understood.\nSorry i'm here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what you just did ready this this cross here this this exact cross where the parental generation is true breeding for a given tree.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they give rise. Andrew Ippolito: To an F1. Andrew Ippolito: That has heterozygous.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, this because right now we can do a pundit square now I can show you how punished squares work.\nAndrew Ippolito: This so pun, it was a British scientist to in the early 1900s developed this mathematical shorthand to visualize these kinds of traits so here's here's how public squares work let's go let's go back to the whiteboard here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what i'm about to teach you is the workflow for every genetics question you do step one as you set up your parental make sure you understand what you're crossing so let's just go back to the original we just.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, another piece of advice is always write your capital a lowercase letters, so that they are visibly distinct from one another notice, I draw capital why like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a lowercase y like this, I don't draw capital why like this and a lower case, why like this, or a capital why like this and a lowercase y like that notice that they're different why.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you're when you're doing your math and you're scribbling and during the test for the quiz and you're writing fast, you might not be able to see the size differences clearly so visually distinguish them.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's My advice to you alright so step one set up set up the cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: step to. Andrew Ippolito: map out the gametes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the key here is, you have to look at this and ask yourself, this is the magic question write this down how many distinct.\nAndrew Ippolito: gametes or how many unique gametes or how many different gametes can be formed by that you know type, in this case it's an easy answer one there's just this capital.\nAndrew Ippolito: For this one is lowercase. Andrew Ippolito: OK, and then step three.\nAndrew Ippolito: is set up your opponent Square.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is how the square works along the top access you put the gametes for one parents notice, I said the gametes not the letters eventually will be doing things that look like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: right for different trades that still one thing okay so you're right the genome type of the gamut here, in this case it's really simple there's just one and then along the next axis you do the other one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, in the middle, you put them together the rule here is capital letters always go first.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's that's as simple as you get right there. Andrew Ippolito: that's your that's literally a square.\nSquare. Andrew Ippolito: And so you can say that, so the inside here the contents of this is the next generation right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So these are the guy means to the principal generation and then this is the F1.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then for. interpret. Andrew Ippolito: And there's 1000 different things, you can do there, depending on the question alright, so now you got that basic concept of my list just map this out again so we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here is a ready i'm gonna say this out loud here's our true breeding yellow pea plant crossed with a true breeding green pea plan each develops their own individual gametes that can then come together and give us our F1 heteros like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now let's take the F1 and self cross it here's how you're going to set that cross up so here's capital a lowercase wide cross with capital a lowercase y now, you can see where things are going to get interesting right the gametes here how many different gametes can be formed there.\nAndrew Ippolito: So Jordan you'll see we're getting there.\nAndrew Ippolito: How many different unique gametes can I form they're. Andrew Ippolito: chill good capital wireless cookies right.\nAndrew Ippolito: The same with this one Capital y lowercase y so now here's how you set up the punter square you put all possible gametes along the top.\nAndrew Ippolito: All possible gummy smile on the bottom. Andrew Ippolito: And then there's your for Jordan.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so now, not all punish yourself for this one does we're going to see squares the messiest one we're going to do is one with 16.\nAndrew Ippolito: The diehard Red Cross, I roll my eyes at that too.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's they fill this out look at the top left corner to capital wise right that's easy capital I capital y.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then remember the rule this where you have to remember your rule capital y so we're seeing here, this is what your brains doing when you're looking at this you're like this and that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you ask yourself, is there a capital letter there if the answer is yes, you put that one first.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because watch this the next one down here capital y lowercase y that's exactly the same as this one right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Even though they're written opposite the cell is three dimensional it doesn't matter what's actually going on, whereas Can you see that if you accidentally drew if you wrote this instead your brain would see these as two different things.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they're not. Andrew Ippolito: The order doesn't matter, so we have a convention capital letters first.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, this last one lowercase, by the way right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now the key here is remember. Andrew Ippolito: This was him mapping this out after doing the experiment, so the only way we know that.\nAndrew Ippolito: The heterozygous. Andrew Ippolito: Is yellow because we did the experiment there's nothing here that tells us that we did that work already so we now know if I see this genome type.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's its phenotype.\nTaylor Campbell: I know. Taylor Campbell: What is it the one he circled.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes. yellow. Andrew Ippolito: Good.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so ready. Andrew Ippolito: So here. Andrew Ippolito: Right what's this so what's the phenotype here.\nTaylor Campbell: yellow. Andrew Ippolito: yellow yellow. yellow.\nTaylor Campbell: Green. Andrew Ippolito: And look at that 321. Taylor Campbell: see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words mendel's model matched his experiment, and so there I just walked you through an example of the scientific method from start to finish.\nAndrew Ippolito: The empirical data remember remember sciences, a blending of empiricism and rationalism right, this was the logic part he did the empirical part and they agreed with each other, which means he's onto something."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 1) - Introduction to Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/UHM1lJTu5PE?si=TbxLXWc-edh9i1hY","chunkTitle":"Mendel's Second Law: Law of Independent Assortment","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces Mendel's second law, the law of independent assortment. He discusses the relationship between different traits and demonstrates how to use Punnett squares to predict offspring phenotypes for multiple traits.","start":"1:06:19","end":"1:15:36","content":"Andrew Ippolito: The empirical data remember remember sciences, a blending of empiricism and rationalism right, this was the logic part he did the empirical part and they agreed with each other, which means he's onto something.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so now what we could do here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well that's it, we can stop there, so that's how we establish this first law, and this is technically so now, now that we've done this starting we zoom out here, starting with the original parental.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here, let if we really stick this take all this and put it here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, all this and put it here right, so this is from starting with the true breeding, I mean increase my starting with the true breeding per Rentals.\nAndrew Ippolito: doing the F1 cross and getting to the F two Okay, this whole thing here, this is called a Mano hybrid cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mano hybrid the mono corresponds to the fact that we're looking at a single trade pea color.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if that made sense to you, these principles here can now just be used to come up with everything else in that chapter.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's no new concepts really.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so the second, the second set of experiments, he did was he asked this question.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the relationship between different traits different phenotypes and other words, is there a special relationship between dominant factors and recessive factors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so what what he did was he established true breeding plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: that were true breeding for to treat at the same time right so let's just keep this in mind here's another impart a little insight that I didn't necessarily have when I was first learning this that'll give to you.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this yellow pea plant imagine the female plant that he actually grow right, so we got this plant.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it has you know branches on it and it's got flowers and it has piece that it gives off those peas, you know when when you pull out the piece or yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: But this plant here, maybe it's tall, maybe it's short maybe it's flowers or purple maybe the flower right there's all those other traits.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's no rhyme and reason to what's there there's no they're not true breeding for every tree right there he just picked people in color i'm sorry he just pea color there.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's an important consideration keep in mind when you're thinking about your eye color while there's all the other traits you have to.\nAndrew Ippolito: write so so an important concept here as a student of genetics is you, the researcher the student the thinker, you are thinking about one treat within a sea of trades you can't keep you have to keep that in mind.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what he did was he established a true breeding plan that was always so so he established that tall is dominant over short alright so let's zoom back in now, so we can write in normal normal not here so tall and short capital T.\nAndrew Ippolito: Capital T tall. Andrew Ippolito: lowercase T shirt.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I could sit here and map out, you know you have your true breathing crossed like this there's your F1 that gives rise to the 321 left to right parental F1 F2 same same exact thing is just tease instead of wise.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so now now we're going to show you what it looks like when you have both at the same time, this is how you would write these out.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the homozygous dominant for both treats capital y capitalized so you put those letters together and then capital T capital T and that right there, that is, the genome type.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you would say that that's you know that's the mom so that is a tall.\nAndrew Ippolito: yellow plant I just cartoony like that. Andrew Ippolito: crossed.\nAndrew Ippolito: With a green. Andrew Ippolito: Short plan.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So if I allowed if I allowed this plant to self pollinate I would always get tall yellow and if I allowed this plant, the self pollinate I would always get short green that's how we establish their true breeding right, so he did that for several generations.\nAndrew Ippolito: sort of weeded out any other weirdos. Andrew Ippolito: no pun intended weeding growing plants okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, once we establish this. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's just not again every single cross he did here right he did that reciprocal cross off the female was the tall yellow in this cross he had a separate cross where the where the mail was the toilet.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: Okay here's where you're going to make your mistakes now so pay careful attention the guy means it's all about the gathering information, this is the skill that students mess up the most Okay, the trick here is to understand that there are two sets there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And remember the first law for every trait there is one factor one factor for each trade there's two traits here, so the gametes are going to have two factors, one for each trade there's going to be a capital y and the capital T that's the gametes gino type.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's the skill, you need to develop ganymede gino type.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So the square here how many squares and my dry.\nAndrew Ippolito: One or four. or.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the mistake. Andrew Ippolito: that's the mistake, a lot of you're going to make when you do this out for the first time you're going to want to do this ready, I want to draw this the way the student who's learning, this would do it incorrectly you're going to do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you see who I think of the offspring here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like what's this. Andrew Ippolito: Right right, so this this is this doesn't exist in nature, where this is just what you're doing here is basically a it's like writing the wrong formula in a physics question right there's no correlation to the real world about this let's just undo all this and watch this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this becomes the thing on the top and this becomes the thing on the side right, so what what the column headers are when you write a public square it's the gamma gino type it's not a ladder.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and if you want circle these things, so you can see one thing there right there's still one thing it's just complicated.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so to felt upon a square you consider each letter individually one, at a time so i'm going to see at the top here, this is what my brain is doing, I see a capital y.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I see that lower case, why, and so I right capital y lowercase y and then my brain next sees capital boy that's really not a color I should be using here capital T lowercase T and so all right capital T lowercase T.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's how my brain see.\nAndrew Ippolito: When I just erased an appropriate amount of information here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you would say 100% of the F1 right that's the F1 in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, what color is that, as a phenotype.\nJulia Lakchin: yo yo. Andrew Ippolito: and hopes, but hey look at me that should be lowercase T.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and, by the way, when we do this, sometimes i'm writing fast, if you see me write a mistake call me on it please right, I will occasionally do that and I don't mean to and i'm going to teach you wrong, and so I luckily I caught that but.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what's the phenotype there that I just circled. Taylor Campbell: Oh good.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so, in other words. Andrew Ippolito: Just like. Andrew Ippolito: Just like doing the single trade so far, so good right everything's making sense there's no short greens and Paul yellows and short yells and Todd it's just all what Mendel would have predicted based on his model Okay, and now here's where.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to do this, one time this is kind of a, this is an initiation into genetics everybody's got to do this, at least once this is called a die hybrid cross."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 1) - Introduction to Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/UHM1lJTu5PE?si=TbxLXWc-edh9i1hY","chunkTitle":"Dihybrid Crosses","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains dihybrid crosses, which involve the inheritance of two different traits.

Andrew Ippolito: you compare notes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I did I did it this way, so we're just going to do that cross to itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now here's here's the skill, this is what we've been building this up to us like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Close gametes so here's My first question to you how many distinct gametes can be formed.\nAndrew Ippolito: With the genome. Andrew Ippolito: Type capital, while okies whitechapel historic easy. Sami Jordan: To do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here to. Andrew Ippolito: Anyone I see for OK for is the correct answer now, do you guys remember doing this in math class.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually let's do. Andrew Ippolito: Number factoring.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like yes, and please don't ever say that word again. Andrew Ippolito: Okay ready Do you remember this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Number the foil method is kind of fun right first outside inside last just do that ready here i'll use color markers first would be these two okay so you're just think think of it mathematically.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm just just to relate it to the foil you know it's like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's not actually what's going on but, but so you like first outside inside I know gosh outside outside.\nAndrew Ippolito: Inside let's see, let me just do all that mess. Andrew Ippolito: So this is how you would write it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, first, so the first gamma it would look like this capital I capital T.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right outside that would be the yellow here capital y lowercase T.\nAndrew Ippolito: inside. Andrew Ippolito: That would be lowercase oh boy lowercase capital T.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then last which i'll just use white here lowercase y lowercase.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and i'm not going to redraw that for the second what's the scene.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's how you draw upon a square. Andrew Ippolito: And i'll use actually get my ruler out for this, so this is gonna be a bunch of lines here.\nAlexa Deprisco: Excuse me, yes, is the third phenotype there the whites he shouldn't be T Y or is that, just like.\nAndrew Ippolito: So notice that I always put the wife first and I OK, so that I understand why you ask that question to you, you told us capital letters first.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the reason why that's a violation of seeming violation that rule is capital risk first for a given factor pair.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so it's there's kind of a hierarchy here the letters always have to be in the same positions, the wiser always hear the teaser always here and then within those the capital letters than the lowercase letters.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it's almost like there's an order of operations here to just like Pam deaths number, please excuse my dear aunt Sally or how did what did you guys, do you guys know that differently, they still use that same acronym this number PEM DAS.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right parentheses exponents multiplication division addition subtraction, what do you guys, what do you guys say out loud when you're learned that when your kids now, we learned, please excuse my dear aunt Sally.\nTaylor Campbell: I use that to, and then they changed it to like penn dot.\nAndrew Ippolito: What. Andrew Ippolito: I heard pen dot like the Pennsylvania department transportation.\nTaylor Campbell: it's like a Panda yeah. Taylor Campbell: Something like that yeah Panda.\nAndrew Ippolito: Panda but there's no so they get rid of subtraction. Taylor Campbell: It was just different they changed everything and I don't use that it's just.\nTaylor Campbell: A simplified it in a way. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, they crushed, or they probably have addition subtraction is one thing and multiple.\nAndrew Ippolito: Operations yeah yeah okay. Taylor Campbell: And they. Oh wow.\nAndrew Ippolito: everything's changed, I feel so old. Andrew Ippolito: My kids are learning math anymore, they just learned how to use a calculator they're still learning math just kidding.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, ready, here we go here's how you do this. Andrew Ippolito: Actually let's even so is that 1234 i'll even use like these inch markers.\nAndrew Ippolito: There we go. Andrew Ippolito: And then i'm going to just kind of eyeball the rest of this so here's here's how you draw the top of it ready capital I capital CCL that's one slot capital a capital T capital why lowercase T lowercase y capital T lowercase a lowercase T.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't want to get rid of the circle now. Andrew Ippolito: And then, because we're doing exactly the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: Capital I capital T capital a lowercase T lowercase y capital T lowercase y Laura keeps.\nAndrew Ippolito: Practice your street line drawn.\nAndrew Ippolito: The differences that first, is that the key there is you start your peers, for your arm, you have your pivot point is your elbow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can draw right it's an art lessons, you can draw a nice straight line pivot point to your elbow ankle fast.\nAndrew Ippolito: selections you map it out, once you put your pencil where you want to start the line and then without drawing anything you travel along where you want to end the line.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so you establish that and then you finally make the mark right, so you go like that it's it's a skill that's good for public squares.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now we follow the rules we consider these, and we consider these we see, we would say this so i'm not going to write this out let's just fast forward so what I usually traditionally do is I make everybody write this out, but let's just skip out here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so I would say capital I capital I capital D capital T capital a capital a capital T lowercase T.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right capital y lowercase y capital T. Andrew Ippolito: Capital a lowercase capital lowercase.\nAndrew Ippolito: and so on and so forth right so go ahead, if you want to fill that out, but I want to i'm just going to steal.\nAndrew Ippolito: The one I I wrote over here in PowerPoint. Andrew Ippolito: Here it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the interest of time, I want to teach you the important stuff here here's what we would do here's how we're going to see this let's think about the phenotypes let's think about what we would call them we would say yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: tall. Andrew Ippolito: Or we would say yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: short. Andrew Ippolito: Or we would say green.\nAndrew Ippolito: tall.

Andrew Ippolito: Or we would say yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: short. Andrew Ippolito: Or we would say green.\nAndrew Ippolito: tall. Andrew Ippolito: Or we would say green short right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those are the possibilities so here's the question Mendel asked.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do dominant factors. Andrew Ippolito: stick together.\nAndrew Ippolito: or do they sort independently. Andrew Ippolito: If they stuck together.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which to phenotypes would he only see. Taylor Campbell: High yellow.\nand Taylor Campbell: Green short. Andrew Ippolito: Almost so tall yellow what would be the opposite of tall yellow.\nTaylor Campbell: yellow short. Good. Sami Jordan: No. Andrew Ippolito: No, not so I spoke too soon.\nTaylor Campbell: Green shirt. Andrew Ippolito: The opposite right. Andrew Ippolito: So you're calling yellow or your short angry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just like mom and dad right back in the p generation. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, if the treats stuck together, we would only see those two in a three to one ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: However, if the capital wise and the lowercase wise and the capital, a lowercase us were able to assert independently, we would see all four of them, and not just that there would be a specific mathematical ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so here's where we can establish that watch this if we take so here, you call it out for me tell me the phenotype.\nTaylor Campbell: Oh yeah. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: right here, let me use a different color this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I can i'll do both the highlighting and the drawing here. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so we said right ty yellow that's one for that how about this one.\nJulia Lakchin: Oh yeah. Julia Lakchin: Oh yeah.\nFor sure very. Sami Jordan: Short grain.\nSami Jordan: Talking. Sami Jordan: or.\nAndrew Ippolito: Short yellow.\nTaylor Campbell: yellow. Taylor Campbell: yellow.\nTaylor Campbell: tall. Taylor Campbell: tall yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, but that's not supposed to be there. April Neeld: I was gonna say that squares.\nApril Neeld: yeah. Andrew Ippolito: This Oh, this is me typing it a long time ago I OK so here let's.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the idea here is i'm not just quickly.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I did this, if I filled all this out, we would get. Andrew Ippolito: We would get nine.\nAndrew Ippolito: yellow towels. Andrew Ippolito: We would get three yellow shorts and three Green towels and all the word CDs remember the phrase recombinant phenotype that I introduced to you last time.\nAndrew Ippolito: To see how those are recombinant right there yellow like mom but short like dad or their green like dad and tall like mom Okay, so we would call these to hear those are the recombinant you know types Mendel didn't use that word that came later.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you see how we go ahead alyssa. Andrew Ippolito: Like a recombinant phenotype would be like one dominant and recessive food scene, not necessarily it would be one from mom and one from debt so so recombinant means the offspring has.\nAndrew Ippolito: A combination of the traits from both parents.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, because the opposite of that so so the yellow tall is just like mom right and the short green here there's only one of those is just like that we would call these two the parental phenotypes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in other words offspring that are exactly like either parent would be perennials.\nAndrew Ippolito: And offspring that have a blending of the two or a combination of the two would be recombinant phenotypes and the magic ratio here is 9232321.\nAndrew Ippolito: And as complicated as that is it's always the same whenever you take two traits that are both men dalian simple dominant recessive pattern tools.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you have true breeding of each you will always get 9232321 This is something I want you to burden to your head and remember forever.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is one of the things you can brag brag about a party, you can see, this ready to say you say it out loud the phenotypic ratio of a di hybrid crosses 9232321."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 1) - Introduction to Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/UHM1lJTu5PE?si=TbxLXWc-edh9i1hY","chunkTitle":"Law of Independent Assortment","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces Mendel's second law, the Law of Independent Assortment.","start":"1:28:56","end":"1:30:05","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This is one of the things you can brag brag about a party, you can see, this ready to say you say it out loud the phenotypic ratio of a di hybrid crosses 9232321.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's how you lose friends at parties.\nAndrew Ippolito: But be able like burn that in the phenotypic ratio of a die hybrid cross 932321 and here's why you have to burn it in if we ever do a cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we don't get 93 2321 that means we've learned something new.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this experiment here mendel's investigation into the relationship between two sets of factors this led to his second law.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is a law that you've already learned about when you did meiosis This is called the law.\nAndrew Ippolito: of independent assortment.\nAndrew Ippolito: I see a chat message here.

Andrew Ippolito: they're pretty straightforward.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but I, I encourage you guys you this is this is like a math thing now right, so this is a skill set you want to you want to study this through doing the problems by practicing.\nAndrew Ippolito: In Khan academy should have a whole whole sets of them. Andrew Ippolito: Just Be careful don't start doing this can get pretty advanced there could be some really advanced thing, so all questions that you come across will have something called an illegal key the illegal key will give you the rules, you know it'll say you know why capital y equals yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: lowercase y equals green and then the question itself will tell you that yellow is dominant the green or something like that the key is this like an algebra you solve for X, the only way, you can solve for X in in math is what what has to be true to solve for X actually get an answer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think about the strategies in your early math classes, if you if you have a question like.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I said solve for X. Andrew Ippolito: there's only one way, you can solve for X and what's that.\nAndrew Ippolito: What do you have to know in order to solve for X. Danuta Despagne: You subtract seven to the other side actually.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but. Andrew Ippolito: But more I see I put two other variables in there. Andrew Ippolito: I put the y and Z. Julia Lakchin: You have to know the other two variables.\nAndrew Ippolito: Exactly exactly. Andrew Ippolito: Julia. Andrew Ippolito: You have to know everything except one thing that's, the only way, you can solve problems for a single variable you have to know all the other variables let's all remember when we learned about how science experiment or setup you change one variable.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you have this the set of knowns and then you have the one unknown and so every genetics problem that is thrown at you.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the things will be missing so here let's just play with the idea of this simple yellow and green right so imagine.\nAndrew Ippolito: We didn't know up front that yellow was dominant the Green and I just said, I have a pure breeding yellow plant and a pure breeding green plant and I do.\nAndrew Ippolito: A Mano hybrid cross, and I see that the the phenotypic ratio is 321 where there's three Greens for every one yellow, which is the dominant trait.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can immediately tell me the answer that hopefully. Julia Lakchin: Green is. Good. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, whereas you can see, I, so I can take that whole scenario, and I can say, instead, I can say.\nAndrew Ippolito: yellow is dominant to green, what would the phenotypic ratio be if I crossed a header was like it was a homozygous recessive.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah okay wait heterozygous crossed with a homozygous recessive what's the phenotypic ratio there, while seo upon a square would look like this, I here we go like on a score look like this right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so I will see capital in there okay spoiler so the phenotypic ratio is 50.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you can just make up your own problems right do a do all the crosses to do you know this cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do this cross. Andrew Ippolito: Maybe do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are you do this cross right just mix and match homozygous dominant to homozygous domino homozygous dominant heterozygous just play around with it, you know and do diverts maybe, do you know, so I could say there is a P plant that is pure breeding free yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: actually here i'll teach you this is the next thing anyway it's called the test cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: ready i'm going to set up a scenario for you you're gonna like this, and this is the last 10 minutes of class you guys are all tired anyway let's say that we were going into business together and we wanted to sell green pea plans i'm sorry we wanted to sell Greenpeace.\nAndrew Ippolito: right that you know the all the ball peas are green right. Andrew Ippolito: So so let's let's not sell Greenpeace, because we need, we need a differentiator for business right so let's say yellow piece let's let's grow in can yellow piece so in order to do that, we need yellow people as rate and, ideally, we want true rating llp plans we don't want.\nAndrew Ippolito: heterozygous yellow people ask us sometimes they'll give us green that we throw them away that's a waste.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys with me still making sense Okay, so we go on craigslist and when you look around and we see that there's some some guy who's selling.\nAndrew Ippolito: Pure breeding yellow pea plants guaranteed $5. Andrew Ippolito: And so we reach out to him we meet him in a while, while parking lot he POPs his trunk.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he shows you his array of plants and he gives you one and he's right here, he gives you five of them, and you say here's here, these are definitely true breeding players.\nAndrew Ippolito: yellow pea plans alright see you later he did take some money and go you go home and you start thinking about it you're like wait a second.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you know for sure that this top sorry forget the height of it just this yellow plant here do we know if this is true breeding like you said it was it's guaranteed he said it was guaranteed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why don't, we know that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why don't we know for sure that that's a true reading plan. Sami Jordan: there's no way to tell.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it's yellow and he said it was.\ndisplaying the dominant traits so it could have like recessive traits. Andrew Ippolito: Good that's the correct answer, but the joke answer is you bought it on craigslist.\nAndrew Ippolito: don't trust anybody on the Internet. Andrew Ippolito: You probably still your credit card, while you're giving them as cash.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, well that's right we this could be like he said homozygous dominant, but it could also be this right.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't know so here's, so this is what we're about to do this is called the test cross a test Cross is when we have a dominant phenotype but we don't know the genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we can test it. Andrew Ippolito: How would we test it what will be crossed this width.\nAndrew Ippolito: What would be the easiest most cost efficient method to test this P plan to ask the question if its dominant or hybrid homozygous or hybrid.\nAndrew Ippolito: right here, this question is the perfect critical thinking question.\nAndrew Ippolito: Logic your way to the answer. Julia Lakchin: Would you cross it with an uppercase lowercase why.\nAndrew Ippolito: And why would you choose that. Andrew Ippolito: what's the phenotype of that plant.\nJulia Lakchin: tall yellow. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, so we have a tall yellow cross with a tall yellow there's possibilities there that the interpreting the offspring, are going to be complex right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: You could do that but there's a much. Andrew Ippolito: More efficient way.\nAndrew Ippolito: What would be an even better across.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember the the rule and algebra right you want to solve for something you have to know everything else.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the only kind of plant, you know everything about you know type of phenotype. Zachary Lucas: Was you just do a cream one.\nAndrew Ippolito: seconds that. Zachary Lucas: Just easily cream. Andrew Ippolito: One good excellent a green one why because the only why sorry, the only.\nAndrew Ippolito: I just got totally distracted by my stupid pun, why. Andrew Ippolito: that's the only genotype phenotype that makes sense right if I show you a green pea plan you know it's you know type.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have to do any experiments on it it's a known, so you cross the unknown, whether or not so that's the concept of test cross whenever you see the word test cross cross it with homozygous recessive.\nAndrew Ippolito: In this case, green right if we're talking about Brown and black dogs and black is dominant and recessive then we're talking about a Brown.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's the recessive because you know it's you know so watch this what's the genome type of the first one, what we know because it's yellow we know it has to have at least a capital y right.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't know what the second Lila and so we're going to cross that with something we know everything about that's the test cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you can map this out like this right that question mark that could be either a capital y so let's do this, it could either be a capital Y or it could be a lowercase y right, those are those are that's it those are the options, so if we crossed this plant.\nAndrew Ippolito: With unknown let's look at the gametes here. Andrew Ippolito: hey the gametes are either capital Y or I don't know right 5050.\nAndrew Ippolito: This one always gives us the lowercase. Andrew Ippolito: And when I met this planet square at you're going to see the power of the the test cross here watch this.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a rectangle where this is always a lowercase y it's just one it's just one row Okay, and so this now.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's do let's just let's. Andrew Ippolito: run this scenario, like this oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's either that. Andrew Ippolito: Or is that right so possibility one this is always going to be that's right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And possibility to we got a capital y. Andrew Ippolito: And that lowercase y so if the original plan you were sold turned out to be homozygous dominant.\nAndrew Ippolito: And these were our offspring what's the phenotypic ratio there.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here i'll visually simplify this for you so forget that let's see this was let's see this was the truth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, what are the offspring look like. Andrew Ippolito: 100% yellow right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, this is yellow and this is yellow so again, if you so let's retroactively say Okay, so they did sell us a homozygous dominant.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we crossed that with a homozygous recessive well that's mendel's first tree that's it that's the p going to the F1 that's where you have the hundred percent yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but now let's say instead it was lowercase y.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to see oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: So now we're going to see this right for you, we got a lowercase y here and we got a lowercase y there so we're going to see green.\nAndrew Ippolito: 50% yellow 50% green. Andrew Ippolito: So we're going to see a one to one ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's either one or the other right, so you got that yellow plant from the guy at wow and you have at home, a green pea plan you cross them you look at 10 to 20 peas they're all yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know you got a true breeding plant or half of them are green and half of them are yellow you know you got a hybrid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now the question that sometimes gets followed up here with students as well. Andrew Ippolito: How many piece, do you have to count in order to establish that is it just one or two or three that answer that's the statistics question go ask a mathematician I don't have a good answer.\nAndrew Ippolito: i've been told by statisticians that for something simple like this the number 23 is the magic number to get that probability up to that your P value of 9.99.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the gold standard is you know your P equals point nine five that just means the probability.\nAndrew Ippolito: right when it was statistics here basically says what are the chances that what we're looking at are due to chance alone.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or what are the chances that we're actually seeing a real effect, and what that P value does is it gives us a confidence score.\nAndrew Ippolito: So point nine five tells us that there's a 95% chance that what we're looking at is not due to chance right and some so it really for some things you want to value of 99.\nAndrew Ippolito: Especially if it's a high stakes 5% chances happen, let me 5%.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right so that's the test cross now the PowerPoint while through the PowerPoint and you're studying.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what I would say is you know outline your chapter do the practice problems but go back to the PowerPoint PowerPoint has a whole bunch of good stuff in it that that's you know that I basically narrated.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have to worry about the die hybrid test cross Okay, or rather a test cross with two traits and then we're going to make you do that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: But that's so that's simple men Delia and inheritance.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we yeah good so we're right on schedule that's where I wanted to start and finish mental today and I did that so and it's one oh to the tech they finish two minutes ago, so i'm on track.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so feel free to bug me on zoom so you guys are going to be doing these questions and you're going to hit a wall with something."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 1) - Introduction to Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/UHM1lJTu5PE?si=TbxLXWc-edh9i1hY","chunkTitle":"Conclusion","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito wraps up the lecture and encourages students to practice and ask questions.","start":"1:44:48","end":"1:45:13","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so feel free to bug me on zoom so you guys are going to be doing these questions and you're going to hit a wall with something.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you hit that wall show me a question I wanted i'll get you over the wall very I could probably give you one or two sentences and how you're thinking, but definitely get good at this and I promise you, your quizzes will have practice problems in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.

Andrew Ippolito: More people accepted his theory at the turn of last century than they do today in America.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that might have changed that might have changed we're we're moving the Needle, finally, but I remember a couple years back, it was like.\nAndrew Ippolito: A few fewer than 80% of people accepted evolution or 60 60% it was almost like 5050.\nStart recording here."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 2) - Human Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=kef3MQLsVwLsoqgu","chunkTitle":"Introduction","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the lecture and recaps the previous session on Mendelian genetics.","start":"0:01","end":"0:28","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So this is our we're picking up where we sort of where we left off last time last time we learn the basics of how Mendel performed his experiments and we learned how to.\nAndrew Ippolito: carry out a simple men dalian genetics problem using punished squares a simple single gene or two genes to treats dominant recessive relationships okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: We want to do here now it's just there's two mathematical laws that have to be taken into account when you're when you're working through these problems there's the love."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 2) - Human Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=kef3MQLsVwLsoqgu","chunkTitle":"Mathematical Laws in Genetics","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the two mathematical laws that need to be considered in genetics problems: the rule of addition and the rule of multiplication.","start":"0:28","end":"6:29","content":"Andrew Ippolito: We want to do here now it's just there's two mathematical laws that have to be taken into account when you're when you're working through these problems there's the love.\nAndrew Ippolito: dive the formal names for these, but basically it's some. Andrew Ippolito: One of them has to do with a single event.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we're we're going to think about a single coin toss. Andrew Ippolito: let's do this so single coin toss right, you can either get a heads or you can get a test right you flip a coin it's one or the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's one possibility here and there's one possibility here right, so you would say that each one of those gives us there's a half out of one right or you could also think of this, you can think 50% or you could think 0.5 right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason you're right 0.5 here's a little lab lab skill, for you, the reason why you always write a 0.5 for decimals is, if you just read Point five and you're scribbling it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Especially if you're writing notes for somebody else they might miss the decimal point, which is why you always do the preceding zero right So if you keeping a lab notebook that's why we put the zero first so anyway, each of these are equivalent terms, so if I asked you.\nAndrew Ippolito: For a single event, what are the chances that you're going to flip a coin and get a heads, you would say there's a 50% chance, or you would say that it's one half right.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I asked you this question, which is kind of weird, what are the chances for single coin toss of getting either a heads or tails.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the answer. Taylor Campbell: Well i'm. Andrew Ippolito: 100% so the reason why you that, so the mathematical way to carry that out, is to add it together Okay, so this is the rule of addition.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's think of something a little more complicated let's say that we were playing a game, and we had a four sided die.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so it would look kind of like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where are the possibilities will be up on the top here so you'd roll the dice and you'd look at this right, so that could be there a one or two or three or four.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so ready, this is easy what What if I asked you so let's say that we were playing a game, and I said you had a if you rolled a one, two or three you would win So what are your chances of winning.\nAndrew Ippolito: quick. Julia Lakchin: three out of four. Andrew Ippolito: three out of four good.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what House can you see that. Julia Lakchin: 75%. Andrew Ippolito: Perfect okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, and all you did was so there's there's a one fourth chance of getting a one there's a one fourth chance of getting into and there's a one foot chance of getting a three it's that simple OK so again we're talking about a single event.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright that's how you calculate the probabilities of us all the possible outcomes right if you were playing with a 52 of the deck of cards 52 forget the joker's.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I said, where the probabilities of drawing a queen right, we know that there's four Queens in the deck so that would be for out of 52.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right 1234 because you add them together now what if I said, what are the probabilities of drawing consecutively in two consecutive let's let's do two consecutive coin tosses let's keep it simple again first okay two consecutive two.\nAndrew Ippolito: consecutive tosses. Andrew Ippolito: Right, the key here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is that the events multiple events they are independent of one another.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the the outcome of the first event does not influence the outcome of the second event right a fair coin toss heads or tails and then another one heads or tails.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first coin toss doesn't influence the second one they're still rent right so here's here's kind of here's a trick question after flipping a coin once you've got a heads.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the probability of flipping a coin a second time and also getting a heads.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: Right, because that second coin toss is not influenced by the first it's always going to be 5050 but now, what if I phrase it this way you're holding a coin, what are the probabilities of you flipping that coin once and getting a heads and then flipping it a second time and getting it.\nTaylor Campbell: But I reduce. Zachary Lucas: My person.\nAndrew Ippolito: If we saw the answer 25% but what did tell her say. Taylor Campbell: Like i'm sorry my kids screaming at me.\nOh. Andrew Ippolito: I thought it was something like that she's like you're I don't want you learning probabilities you know too much already.\nTaylor Campbell: Hearing anything without ours, using say i'm. Taylor Campbell: Like it would reduce would it look like.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here watch this. Taylor Campbell: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: You have you have two events. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the first event I told you, I want it to be a heads and the second one, I also wanted to be heads the key is you don't know the outcome, yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the first example, like the trick question was I told you, you have a heads what's the second one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay 50% now i'm telling you you don't know here's a coin flip it twice what are your chances of getting a heads and ahead, so the first time.\nAndrew Ippolito: The chance of getting a heads or one half right, and the second coin toss the chances of getting it or one half what you do here is you multiply those two things together, and you get one fourth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay Now you can visualize this you can, if that's not intuitive to you which maybe it's not at first when you look at it.\nAndrew Ippolito: If we take that concept of, to coin tosses and we map it out watch this So the first coin toss can either be a heads."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 2) - Human Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=kef3MQLsVwLsoqgu","chunkTitle":"Examples of Classic Human Genetic Disorders","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses four examples of classic human genetic disorders: albinism, cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, and sickle cell disease.","start":"11:19","end":"26:09","content":"Andrew Ippolito: test crosses love and have been a swarm and pop up there, we go this is where things start to get interesting human genetics, this is what we're going to learn about now.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so for us for the first of the test for Friday, what I want you to do is be able to pull these things out of a lineup I want you to recognize the different types of examples of classic human genetic disorders, that are either homozygous recessive or.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, here we'll go through them here, the key is it's there's no difference here between yellow and green piece except instead of getting a green pea you get a disease.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so that's the idea of a recessive disease. Andrew Ippolito: And so the four examples that we're going to cite here are albinism cystic fibrosis tay Sachs disease and sickle cell disease, each one of these genetic disorders, can be traced to a single gene that is present in our populations in only two variants there's tools.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: In order to present with the disease.\nAndrew Ippolito: You need to be homozygous recessive. Andrew Ippolito: So this allows people to be completely healthy and and not a carrier or they could be healthy asymptomatic and be a carrier.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, would be the heterozygous right. Andrew Ippolito: or they can present with the disease.\nAndrew Ippolito: So for albinism. Andrew Ippolito: So, first of all there's different kinds of albinism the one that we're talking about in particular is called oculus cutaneous albinism or oca.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's one of seven different genes that can be mutated but regardless of which gene mutated it's a single obo that's me too, and so here's here's the concept of a recessive trait here's here's why it happens.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, think think about this idea here let's. Andrew Ippolito: Actually let's let's go back now because they're writing for it let's do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea here is that the recessive Leal if you think of the genetics of it right here here's the DNA for capital, a and here's the DNA for lowercase.\nAndrew Ippolito: And these are the a's and t's and c's and US Okay, the lowercase a has a mutation in it somewhere that, for whatever reason, and it varies depending on the gene will disable the gene from doing this job okay it's called a loss of function mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a loss of function mutation. Andrew Ippolito: can be compensated for if there's a second illegal there that's just fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: As long as you got a good one, you can still get the job done you just don't have a backup copy anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I can now explain to you why piece can be yellow or green it turns out the gene that controls this controls, the destruction of chlorophyll.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we can tie this together with photosynthesis you're gonna really you can truly understand this now during the developmental fees of plants, they their entire body is expressing photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll.\nAndrew Ippolito: And only upon maturation does the chlorophyll start to be turned off and activated and the tissues that don't need it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like think of a you know, a tree think of the the trunk of a tree and the bark Ray that that's all or the the veins right you just planning parts of plants that are empty, so the green pea is supposed to be yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the Green is supposed to get the grid, and so, for the capital, a capital a or for the capital, a lowercase say.\nAndrew Ippolito: A plant that has either those genome types can still get rid of the chlorophyll, which is why they're yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And only having two broken to loss of function leaves does the chlorophyll linger and the plant remains green and the p remains great.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why we have Greenpeace Okay, so you can apply that concept now to human genetics albinism is the result of a lack of pigmentation and that lack of pigmentation is driven by the lack of an enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Taylor Campbell: so sensitive to the sun right. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, Okay, so the key here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is there is a pigment called. Andrew Ippolito: melanin there's different kinds of melanin but for our purposes let's just see it as it's a protein it's expressed within our skin.\nAndrew Ippolito: at varying amounts and that explains the differences in our skin tones and the job of melanin is to absorb UV light to protect our DNA from damage.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like the secret service taking them bullet that's really the best analogy, you can think of its warms it crowds the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that the DNA can be safe from UV UV radiation ionizing radiation will induce DNA damage, the problem is, we need a little UV UV light also triggers our body to produce various things like vitamin D in particular.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's a balance between. Andrew Ippolito: vitamin D, expression and UV damage.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's why, if you look at the earth and you look at where the sun's most intense, you will find that, where people with darker skin live.\nAndrew Ippolito: And as you travel to the North or travel to the south, where the sun gets weaker and weaker our skin has to get lighter and lighter to account for the weaker UV rays, we still need vitamin D.\nAndrew Ippolito: So being dark skinned in a very high latitude means you're not going to get sufficient vitamin D levels you'll have a vitamin D deficiency.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is actually what drove the evolution of human light skin color before about 20,000 years ago, or is it 40,000 years ago or 60,000 years ago 10s of thousands of years ago, all humans were dark skinned.\nAndrew Ippolito: right we evolved in Africa, and we really throughout the globe from Africa and the various areas where we lingered.\nAndrew Ippolito: I have no idea why we lingered so far north in the cold when we evolved in the sun, but you know if nobody else was there, leave me alone i'm going to bring these rocks together and make some fire and I have my freedom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so slowly over the generations, the people that went North just eventually got lighter and lighter skin.\nAndrew Ippolito: to survive because one of the things vitamin D, does it turns out, is it provides a variability and fertility.\nAndrew Ippolito: So vitamin D levels correlate with infertility right so darker skinned people in very higher.\nAndrew Ippolito: latitudes again we're talking over the course of thousands of years here not like a generation or two but hundreds of generations, the people that had darker skin had fewer children that people would lighter skin had more children and slowly over time you got very light skin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So albinism is a disease in which you can't produce melanin all in certain tissues okay so that's why there's different kinds of albinism the classical albinism most people think of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the one where people might have red eyes and very light skin right that's that's not the typical one this in this case it's ocular continuous where the people are blue eyes.\nAndrew Ippolito: They will have red eyes Okay, we find this in the entire animal kingdom there's everywhere, even arthropods you can you can, if you type.\nAndrew Ippolito: albino crab or albino slug or albino anything pick any I don't want you want there's we find albinism everywhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I felt. Taylor Campbell: So now, by no alligator. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah like.\nTaylor Campbell: Good luck in China, like Chinese. Andrew Ippolito: cold oh cool Alex albino alligators are albino in general.\nTaylor Campbell: know the alligators. Andrew Ippolito: I didn't realize that's. Taylor Campbell: The only like five in the world, because they don't survive.\nAndrew Ippolito: which makes sense they're really yeah they. Taylor Campbell: need to be outside. Taylor Campbell: You know right. Andrew Ippolito: Right yeah actually they can focus their actual terms right they can't regulate their body temperature yeah.\nTaylor Campbell: So he was kept in like his own he had his own pool, and he had a show to shed so there was no.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah no that's cool. Taylor Campbell: He was. Taylor Campbell: Really cool. That makes sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: I learned something new today. Andrew Ippolito: Thanks. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, by the way, when you see rare hereditary just syndromes like this her Maskey poor black or chediak higashi those are the names of the researchers that discovered him.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what whenever you see a syndrome or a disease that has multiple names on it that's those are the researchers and by the a syndrome when we say syndrome.\nAndrew Ippolito: syndrome is a collection of. Andrew Ippolito: characteristics are a collection of symptoms that's what the word itself means sin sin sin, the same they're basically they're things that they're found together at the same time it doesn't necessarily mean.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a disease and it doesn't necessarily mean if it is a disease is caused by the same thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, for example, so i'm doing this in Microbiology we're doing the disease stuff, and so the example they use of a syndrome that's not a disease is premenstrual syndrome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right there's a constellation of symptoms that come around for people that suffer from PMs it's not a disease it's a syndrome okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Down syndrome is a collection of characteristics that come together with because of a specific mutation we've tried to do and that is a disease okay so so these words are sometimes used incorrectly.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, alright. Andrew Ippolito: cystic fibrosis is a mutation that occurs in a chloride transporter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Normally a cell can so here it is it's the cystic fibrosis transporter cf tr that's an imaging.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what happens is under and so normal like people without cystic fibrosis they can pump chloride ions out of their cells, in particular, this is happening in their their upper respiratory system they push the chloride out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the water and the and then there's a sodium sodium transporter right so idioms coming in Korean going out so there's a nice homeostasis here and notice that the water reaches an equilibrium point and you see this light blue here that's the water and the greenest basically mucus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sorry, so the idea here is normal people when I say normal people people without the mutation can produce a normal amount of mucus and then you can coats our.\nAndrew Ippolito: entire system and it protects us right, we can trap dust particles and bacteria all sorts of things.\nAndrew Ippolito: People with cystic fibrosis they still have that functioning sodium transporter but they can't pump the chlorine out anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that causes the inside of their cells to be hyper tonic which causes the water to stay in, which means the mucus represented here by this Green is really, really thick.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if you've ever been really, really sick and you had that kind of mucus where it's so thick you can chew it.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the normal kind of mucus that they are producing throughout their in their lungs in their.\nAndrew Ippolito: Soft gizzard cheeky everything their nose so they're they're very susceptible to certain kinds of diseases but, more importantly, they can prove that well.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this leads to a whole set of secondary symptoms.

Andrew Ippolito: can be compensated for if there's a second illegal there that's just fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: As long as you got a good one, you can still get the job done you just don't have a backup copy anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I can now explain to you why piece can be yellow or green it turns out the gene that controls this controls, the destruction of chlorophyll.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we can tie this together with photosynthesis you're gonna really you can truly understand this now during the developmental fees of plants, they their entire body is expressing photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll.\nAndrew Ippolito: And only upon maturation does the chlorophyll start to be turned off and activated and the tissues that don't need it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like think of a you know, a tree think of the the trunk of a tree and the bark Ray that that's all or the the veins right you just planning parts of plants that are empty, so the green pea is supposed to be yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the Green is supposed to get the grid, and so, for the capital, a capital a or for the capital, a lowercase say.\nAndrew Ippolito: A plant that has either those genome types can still get rid of the chlorophyll, which is why they're yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And only having two broken to loss of function leaves does the chlorophyll linger and the plant remains green and the p remains great.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why we have Greenpeace Okay, so you can apply that concept now to human genetics albinism is the result of a lack of pigmentation and that lack of pigmentation is driven by the lack of an enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Taylor Campbell: so sensitive to the sun right. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, Okay, so the key here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is there is a pigment called. Andrew Ippolito: melanin there's different kinds of melanin but for our purposes let's just see it as it's a protein it's expressed within our skin.\nAndrew Ippolito: at varying amounts and that explains the differences in our skin tones and the job of melanin is to absorb UV light to protect our DNA from damage.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like the secret service taking them bullet that's really the best analogy, you can think of its warms it crowds the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that the DNA can be safe from UV UV radiation ionizing radiation will induce DNA damage, the problem is, we need a little UV UV light also triggers our body to produce various things like vitamin D in particular.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's a balance between. Andrew Ippolito: vitamin D, expression and UV damage.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's why, if you look at the earth and you look at where the sun's most intense, you will find that, where people with darker skin live.\nAndrew Ippolito: And as you travel to the North or travel to the south, where the sun gets weaker and weaker our skin has to get lighter and lighter to account for the weaker UV rays, we still need vitamin D.\nAndrew Ippolito: So being dark skinned in a very high latitude means you're not going to get sufficient vitamin D levels you'll have a vitamin D deficiency.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is actually what drove the evolution of human light skin color before about 20,000 years ago, or is it 40,000 years ago or 60,000 years ago 10s of thousands of years ago, all humans were dark skinned.\nAndrew Ippolito: right we evolved in Africa, and we really throughout the globe from Africa and the various areas where we lingered.\nAndrew Ippolito: I have no idea why we lingered so far north in the cold when we evolved in the sun, but you know if nobody else was there, leave me alone i'm going to bring these rocks together and make some fire and I have my freedom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so slowly over the generations, the people that went North just eventually got lighter and lighter skin.\nAndrew Ippolito: to survive because one of the things vitamin D, does it turns out, is it provides a variability and fertility.\nAndrew Ippolito: So vitamin D levels correlate with infertility right so darker skinned people in very higher.\nAndrew Ippolito: latitudes again we're talking over the course of thousands of years here not like a generation or two but hundreds of generations, the people that had darker skin had fewer children that people would lighter skin had more children and slowly over time you got very light skin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So albinism is a disease in which you can't produce melanin all in certain tissues okay so that's why there's different kinds of albinism the classical albinism most people think of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the one where people might have red eyes and very light skin right that's that's not the typical one this in this case it's ocular continuous where the people are blue eyes.\nAndrew Ippolito: They will have red eyes Okay, we find this in the entire animal kingdom there's everywhere, even arthropods you can you can, if you type.\nAndrew Ippolito: albino crab or albino slug or albino anything pick any I don't want you want there's we find albinism everywhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I felt. Taylor Campbell: So now, by no alligator. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah like.\nTaylor Campbell: Good luck in China, like Chinese. Andrew Ippolito: cold oh cool Alex albino alligators are albino in general.\nTaylor Campbell: know the alligators. Andrew Ippolito: I didn't realize that's. Taylor Campbell: The only like five in the world, because they don't survive.\nAndrew Ippolito: which makes sense they're really yeah they. Taylor Campbell: need to be outside.

Angela Harbeck: structure of it, you can see. Angela Harbeck: there's. Angela Harbeck: Something goes disease like kill you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, so what it does. Andrew Ippolito: Is it causes a slow progressive neuro degeneration of the brain, in particular within the caudate nucleus, and the poor and.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see here and phenotypically normal brain right, so what we're looking at here is a coronal section of i'm sorry.\nfrontal section. Andrew Ippolito: yeah cross section of the brain and you see these two little dark areas here, so our brains have these these hollow areas that are filled with fluid.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're called ventricles and they help with the flow of the cerebral spinal fluid all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look at the darker areas here that's the Gray matter, those are Richard neurons and then you'll see the white matter that's rich and support cells called glial cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you'll notice so so the way you think your brain is the surface of your brain that's called the cerebral cortex.\nAndrew Ippolito: The cortex is the outside surface and that's where all the neurons are that's where most of the neurons are, however, deep within the brain are some areas where there's Gray matter to we call those deeper areas nuclei Okay, so not a nucleus, like a cell nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this idea of that nucleus there, so you can see here on a normal person just sitting just on the surface of that ventricle is this thing called the caudate nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, and somebody with progressive huntington's disease you'll see the ventricles are greatly expanded and you'll see that the caudate nucleus is essentially gone almost completely you'll also notice another new feature called the put them in.\nAndrew Ippolito: His is vastly diminished as well, in addition, I mean if you look at the rest of the brain itself, you can see, severe amount of attrition or atrophy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so people that have huntington's eventually their body loses the ability to control itself and eventually the heart and the heart gets deregulated the breathing gets deregulated all the autonomic nervous system functions shut down and they die.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and there's no cure there's there's some treatments for it, you can make people comfortable.\nAndrew Ippolito: and its dominant So if you have it in your family there's a whole level here of bioethics, now is the question is, should you get tested, and if you get positive she got children or not.\nAndrew Ippolito: right then that's a beautiful example of how like science doesn't have answers for those things, all we can do is arm you with knowledge.\nAndrew Ippolito: But at the end of the day, it's up to society to decide what they're going to do about it, for example, if there's a willing society that would ban people that have the huntington's gene from ever having children.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does that impinge on people's freedom or is that something that we should do as a society right, these are the kinds of questions you deal with in something called bioethics, you can go get your PhD in bioethics, if you like those kinds of questions every."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 2) - Human Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=kef3MQLsVwLsoqgu","chunkTitle":"Achondroplasia","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses achondroplasia, a type of dwarfism that affects the long bones in the body.

Andrew Ippolito: um there's other kinds of dwarfism that have different names that i'm not going to get into but this, this is the one So if you ever watch game of thrones before the last season ruined it for everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is tyrion right the him and the the the actor, is a very private guy apparently he lives in Manhattan."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 2) - Human Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=kef3MQLsVwLsoqgu","chunkTitle":"Polydactyly","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains polydactyly, a condition characterized by the presence of extra fingers or toes.

Andrew Ippolito: All right, good.\nTaylor Campbell: So, specifically for like.

Andrew Ippolito: there's different kinds of pod actually and the key is it's when and where the its genetic stutter basically if you look at the the volunteer in the feet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so these kinds of bonds are called your phalanges Okay, and the idea here is one phalange leads to another leads to another what happens during pod actually.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is there's a fork that occurs, and then you get a repeat there so depending on where that forking occurs, it can occur down here, or it can occur here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or, I suppose I, in theory, I suppose it can occur anywhere, so people that have like a fully functional hand that duplication event happens deep, whereas if they have what you could you know describe it like a little extra just a nub that would occur far further away.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so and then, in this case here this duplication would have happened here right, whereas, in this case the duplication would have happened here.\nTaylor Campbell: Is it painful at all.

Andrew Ippolito: And we already talked about this, so you can see this, this is a normal human female carrier type and here's a normal human male character, you can see the y chromosome how small it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now here's an interesting little of interesting fact, and that is there are some regions of the y chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: That could be mapped to the X chromosome, in other words, there is some homology there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and because of that homology crossing over can occur between the X and the y chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: And therefore, it is rare, but completely normal it's part of the diversity within the human population that people can be born X X, but because of some crossing over event that occurred, they can feed on typically look male.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there, there are rare instances where people can have crossing over occur between the excellent like chromosome and present with sexual current secondary sexual characteristics that are not representative of their genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay This just goes to show you that it's not a binary situation another example of that.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: So i'm not going to spend any great amount of time on any of these, I want to kind of move forward here to see muscular dystrophy is a progressive weakening of the muscles usually it's a boys that are born with this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they generally grow up kind of normal and then they reach a certain age where they start atrophying and that's that's a muscular dystrophy so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Progressive weakening of the muscles the gene is the dmd gene and the protein is destruction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, these proteins help keep the the muscle tissue itself intact.\nAndrew Ippolito: hemophilia is characterized by people who basically can't caught their blood quickly and easily most of us are familiar with this concept.\nAndrew Ippolito: clotting in as part of the human will wound healing response is a complex Multifactorial system that requires a lot of different players.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so there are different types of haemophilia that affect different members of the chain, and so in this case, this is hemophilia a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it affects the gene that encodes for something called coagulation factor eight, so you can start to see how complicated there's other ones that aren't just wanted to provide success.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we denote it like this, so we would say hemophilia a that would be so this would be the equivalent of you writing a lowercase a.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a lot more complicated right, so you have capital H or lowercase H dash because there's an H dash be okay so we're just We just have to use up we invent a new lingo for something that's more complicated.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So this is the pedigree of the royal family in Britain, you can see, here it starts out this is called queen victoria's curse.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's the Victoria Princess of sex coburn 1787 1861 and there's Edward Duke of Kent and they had their daughter Queen Victoria.\nAndrew Ippolito: of England so remember Victoria you've probably heard the phrase Victorian era England that's you know so Darwin was around in pride and prejudice and all the we think about period pieces in England that's Victorian England and she had if you look at this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Look at all those children Queen Victoria had. 1-234-567-8910 that's the kids.\nOkay.

Andrew Ippolito: Now they show her, so this is a retrospective study right she was born, probably with a spontaneous mutation that cause hemophilia.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so she had Alice. Andrew Ippolito: Leopold and Beatrice okay so Leopold he's the famous one he had hemophilia.\nAndrew Ippolito: and actually there's a there's a netflix show I I watched like the first episode of it, a few weeks back it's it's got Sherlock Holmes in it.\nAlexis Micewski: And we are regulars. Andrew Ippolito: Thank you. Yes. Andrew Ippolito: yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah I thought it was good, too, and so one of the characters in it turns out to be Leopold. Andrew Ippolito: And he lives until he's like 3032 years old, and he marries Helen here and so he has Alice who has Rupert.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you so The point is, if you step back and look at this pedigree and you look at the number of offspring that had this very rare genetic disorder.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's where you can see why they trace it back to a curse right they didn't know about genetics back then so Victoria was cursed somehow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right poor Beatrice here she had two sons can see their names here it's kind of hard to read it that's leopolda marie's both haemophiliacs right, and neither of them married and having children, you can see.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so actually I want you to notice. Andrew Ippolito: That all the people and so here ready generation zero generation one generation to generation three generation for by the fourth generation notice that really by the third generation anybody that had hemophiliac notice they didn't have children.\nAndrew Ippolito: That was probably a Royal Decree if I had to guess the get I didn't read the history of this but, either by choice or by their by pressure of the royal family, they knew that the only way to stop it from happening, was to stop perpetuating the bloodline yeah go ahead alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: I mean the ones that you circle, those are already the offspring of like inbreeding right because those two pitches came from Victoria.\nAlexa Deprisco: That disorder right like well. Andrew Ippolito: yeah so that that's a really keen observation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so if you notice let's see a couple or can we see inbreeding here so.\nAlexis Micewski: That Leopold and Helen are like cousins. Alexis Micewski: So there's inbreeding there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well yeah but is there any direct connections on this. Andrew Ippolito: chart yeah yeah so so here's the idea dark Darwin incidentally dawn marriages first cousin.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so first cousin would be so here's Alice say Alice and Leopold these here, so you would say Alice is this alice's they would be.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I can do this right their first cousins. Taylor Campbell: What about her Alice married well that's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh yeah there we go. Andrew Ippolito: There we go there's your incest.\nAndrew Ippolito: I missed that one so yeah. Taylor Campbell: That one's pretty. Andrew Ippolito: yeah I know what fruit fruit, yes, this is so, this is one of the things anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: So yeah Alice Marita brother. Taylor Campbell: hey we're allowed to do that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like pauly if you're a royal royalty was. Andrew Ippolito: So, so the idea was.\nAndrew Ippolito: Royal bloodlines had the good traits and you had to keep the Royal blood concentrated that's why you had to keep it within a small domain and honestly.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you think about it, there was a reason why Edward here was King right, I mean you don't just become King through luck, of the draw you had some traits of dominance or military prowess or whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: That made you king of the castle literally so My guess is is the reason why you see this again and again and again in history is it's a way of concentrating the good traits and, of course, as you can see.\nAndrew Ippolito: It also crops up the bad traits homozygous recessive phenotypes are more common, with an inbreeding that's why i'm reading is frowned upon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the chances of you, having recessive traits are much higher when you have a small gene pool.\nTaylor Campbell: So what clear with this do thank you a die early like How does it affect the proteins understand.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we'll all it does is, if you get cut like just just a paper cut you can't easily quickly stop the bleeding and so you bleed to death.\nTaylor Campbell: So it's like natural blood thinners. Andrew Ippolito: yeah I think what ultimately kill somebody who's a human feel like is they suffer some kind of traumatic injury, that you can ever.\nTaylor Campbell: When you get hurt right like a bruise like internal bleeding like bad like Accenture alternately blade you don't notice and then.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the TV show the irregulars if you watch the first episode. Andrew Ippolito: You can see like he's trapped in his house and his mom there's a lot of Mount yeah go ahead, people.\nApril Neeld: So if a female with this recessive trait and a male or female, with carrier and then a male that has it had a female child would they be hemophilia.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have he was let's map that out okay so go ahead, say, the female that what. April Neeld: email that carries the tree.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I. April Neeld: know that has it. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so here go ahead let's map that out so let's look upon a square we would be.\nTaylor Campbell: So these women would probably die from childbirth and right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh yes. Taylor Campbell: Yes, I like it was more likely. Andrew Ippolito: Right okay So here we go, so we have a female.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is a carrier, but not expressing him, we have a hemophiliac female 25% chance we have a healthy male.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we have a hemophiliac now, so you would say this right here, this is actually April this, this is a great example we can actually use so here's question number one.\nAndrew Ippolito: For a woman who carries the gene marrying a male who's a hemophiliac, what are the chances that they'll have a kid with hemophilia.\nApril Neeld: 50%. Good. Andrew Ippolito: Right, because the male and the female here both have it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then it's 5050 male or female right, what are the chances of their their son having 50% right female having it 50%, what are the chances that this couple will give birth to a child, that is not that would be able to eliminate the disease from the gene pool.\nApril Neeld: 5%. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: Right, the only one here would be the. middle. Andrew Ippolito: Right, because the female is either a carrier or has the tree.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excellent Okay, and that, by the way, this is the level of depth I need you thinking that not any more complicated than this for the test.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So actually i'm going to skip this one, this is, we just talked at length about this, the key here alright So you see, the one that circled in red actually not let's talk about for a second notice how a lot of these geno types have a question mark.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the reason for that is in real life we can't always know everybody's you know gino types we can't blood pipe everybody because we don't have access to their blood necessarily either they passed away or they're not around.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so the best we can say is, we know that this female have the disease right so whatever the phenotype is all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: mary's and now that doesn't have the disease, but we don't know if he's carrying on with the other so here's my question to you, despite the fact that we don't know this, you know type, how can we be certain that this female.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is heterozygous.\nTaylor Campbell: because she doesn't have it. Andrew Ippolito: But neither does her dad.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah but her mom is.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah but she could she could have inherited the question mark, just as easily right we don't know.\nThe baby. Andrew Ippolito: So, again. Taylor Campbell: The babies. Andrew Ippolito: Exactly exactly.\nAndrew Ippolito: She had two kids that, had it. Andrew Ippolito: The only explanation, there is that she had to have been carrying.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good good good good good. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, now, so this is, this is the color blind test right so just just just for fun here quick show hands, how many of you can see.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right what's that say they're. Taylor Campbell: seven. Andrew Ippolito: All right, good right So if you can't see that you're colorblind.\nAndrew Ippolito: What about this one over here. Danuta Despagne: 42 okay good.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, what about this one.\nApril Neeld: Is that one a joke one. Andrew Ippolito: yeah so here's the thing it's it's the joke in the sense of I used to think this was the control you can't see anything, nobody can see anything there, but I actually had a student last semester tell me.\nAndrew Ippolito: That because they did the test, because they had color blindness in their family that what this actually is it's a maze you have to be able to trace a line from one X, to the other X yeah like that blew my mind, I thought it was just a control, but so watch this, you have to be able.\nAndrew Ippolito: to navigate like that. Andrew Ippolito: And if you can't do that you're caught up.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: That so there's three kinds of colorblindness this would just be one time that.\nAndrew Ippolito: determine nope alright people that have a problem with a red and green they can't distinguish it.\nJordan Russell: It was kind of interesting so like going back. Jordan Russell: To our lobster lab we had yesterday and how like we found out the color like the colors of the color of your eyes doesn't like determine if you have color blindness or not.\nJordan Russell: Right like there's always seems to be this stigma with blue eyed individuals that they have more like sensitivity to light.\nJordan Russell: and Jordan Russell: And like people always say. Jordan Russell: That people with blue eyes always have the sensitivity to light, so now like i'm thinking like that's not the case now because of our.\nAndrew Ippolito: Different that's different so so if this is the profile of your I here. Andrew Ippolito: Right here's your iris.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your pick the pigment that make sure I colored is within the iris itself that's right, you know so light lights hitting you.\nAndrew Ippolito: know the whole year, everything is getting hit with light right you're not it's like a laser going in and so people with blue eyes that lack that.\nAndrew Ippolito: The post deposited pigmentation more light will probably pass through the non pigmented part of the irs and that actually explains why.\nAndrew Ippolito: People with blue eyes, probably are a little bit more sensitive to bright light, then people with Brown. Andrew Ippolito: and actually now that you think about it, my wife has very, very light blue eyes and she I remember when I used to do a lot of photography she really couldn't handle the flashes.\nAndrew Ippolito: They were just too much for her and so that's probably because of the light blue eyes, but if I had to him way that way.\nAndrew Ippolito: That was funny I liked as I saw that it's the has coming out of. Andrew Ippolito: The is that a hint that i'm too loud i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm glad.\nAlexis Micewski: he's listening to music and he probably wants me to listen to a song, but I am in class.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So everything we just talked about. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, we talked about a genetic disorder, where you have some gene on the chromosome that's got a problem with it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now we're going to step back and we're going to think of the chromosome itself and we're going to see that we can have problems with the chromosomes now not single genes, but entire either entire swaths of the chromosome or a chromosome themselves.\nAndrew Ippolito: So some some terminology first when we say polly deployed we're talking about a genome within a cell that has many copies, not just being deployed or even trip floyd or tetraploid but polly point like eight sets of chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay plants are all poly point. Andrew Ippolito: So, if you look at say let's like wheat.\nwheat. Andrew Ippolito: gets deployed like see.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have. Andrew Ippolito: To do it 14.\nThe taxonomy of weed. Andrew Ippolito: And I straw actually you know what Plan.\nAndrew Ippolito: just see if I can find a little handy chart that gives a.\nlet's see. Andrew Ippolito: Now I can't find easy one, basically, I mean there's there's loads of research on here I don't want to deal with the origin of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, so i'll just said, so I we I think we is deployed.\nAndrew Ippolito: right they have deployed dough DECO deployed whatever. Andrew Ippolito: And, and the mechanism for that that you might learn that actually went in bio to.\nAndrew Ippolito: You not to worry about the mechanisms there if you're curious about this just type holly palladium plants, and you can look at the Wikipedia to the mechanisms of it, basically, the idea is, if you have a single loan flower think of a lone flower in a field.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if that thing is going to survive it's got to meet with itself, so to speak, right, and so one of the ways, you can do that is through an a sexual reproduction, where it just duplicates it's chromosomes and then it can go through meiosis and so now it's probably played.\nAndrew Ippolito: You just duplicates all of those chromosomes and then I can go through crossing over in meiosis and create gametes and whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you know the progeny of the night now you basically have a new species.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you play it when we say you ploy that EU means well defined technically, but it means it's the correct number okay What this means is you can think of it as as normal right So if I say a.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of your somatic cells your skin cells, those are deployed right they're supposed to be deployed, so you would say that uh you ploy.\nAndrew Ippolito: fibroblasts is deployed, whereas a you floyd sperm cell is happily.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so the opposite of you plays an employed and that's really, this is the word that you're going to throw around a lot 100% of cancer cells are adding a play which just means there's something wrong with them there's something wrong with their genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, cancer cells, by the time their cancer, they are unrecognizable as the source material they came from there, so far gone and they're all that extra chromosomes their chromosomes are bridging together there's duplications it's just it's a nightmare.\nAndrew Ippolito: So an airplane okay. Andrew Ippolito: Non disjunction non disjunction is this word we use to describe the inappropriate segregation of criticisms.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, for example during meiosis will help me show you pictures here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright So here we have a normal cell there's a homologous pair of chromosomes and you can see that they separate during a Meta phase just totally normally right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then let's let's look at the normal one this one, the sister separate normally right they go in opposite directions, this one, they accidentally all go into a single.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh Okay, they all go to a single cell. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so now here's here's the trick this egg now for just that chromosome not all the chromosomes just that chromosome has two copies, so that when it gets fertilized by the sperm that gets one, you now have three copies.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that. Andrew Ippolito: So, so, in other words let's say that we had you know chromosome one chromosome to chromosome three and chromosome for hypothetical sell for and for notice that we have three copies of this one okay that concept is called trisomy.\nAndrew Ippolito: trisomy and it's always with a number after it like. Jordan Russell: I was supposed to be born with trisomy 18.\nAndrew Ippolito: We say that again. Jordan Russell: I was supposed to be born with trisomy 18 they thought I was going to be born with trisomy 18 in the womb, because apparently I looked like I was in.\nJordan Russell: Like a meditation state like I looked like I was like sitting crisscross applesauce in the womb.\nJordan Russell: Really Indian style so they thought I was going to be born with trisomy 18. Andrew Ippolito: Based on based on your behavior pattern, not a genetic analysis.\nJordan Russell: yeah well. Jordan Russell: Interest based on like how I looked in the womb. Andrew Ippolito: Right right right right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's interesting thanks for sharing Jordan. Andrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: So there are some trisomy.\nAndrew Ippolito: trisomy 21 is the most famous of course that's down syndrome Okay, so in this hypothetical sell that I just drew this would be trisomy three.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's always got to be a number there right because you're not otherwise you're what would this be called if the genome looked like this, what would that be called.\nAndrew Ippolito: What would this genome be.\nJulia Lakchin: Trust me. Andrew Ippolito: No, no, so here, right here, let me. Julia Lakchin: So ready.\nAndrew Ippolito: 1234 this would be what. Andrew Ippolito: like an excel.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that would be hapless. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're assuming and a Fort here alright, so a deployed cell would look like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: oops. Andrew Ippolito: Right, that would be deployed, so what would this be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good that would be AAA. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is trisomy three so that, so I just understand trisomy means we have one extra chromosome of one pair whereas triplet as they're all.\nAndrew Ippolito: three. Andrew Ippolito: OK, so the opposite of this ready this.\nAndrew Ippolito: would be masoni. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, this would be minus only three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right only having one copy of chromosome three so Montessori and tries to me are opposites, and you will see both of them right So if you go back to this picture here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This one would lead to a trisomy zygote right so remember this is fertilization, and so this would be the psychos right as I go.\nAndrew Ippolito: This egg cell here now, this is, be careful here this doesn't mean that he doesn't have any DNA in it we're just tracking one chromosome here right, if you look at the original one.\nAndrew Ippolito: That we're just dealing with one chromosome this egg here does not have any copy of it, so when it gets fertilize it gets one copy and so that state here would be mana so me Mano a Mano so me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mano so me. Andrew Ippolito: This would be trisomy.\nApril Neeld: What you mean stand for so i'm why, because I know that, like like different parts of words mean different things.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know I want to look that up now. April Neeld: So me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Count okay so it's a plural of song so m, and so in line some is the root for number or account.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we're counting so one count or three counts cool thanks for asking that I never ever put that together so me okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so So do you see how, in this in this slide here we have meiosis mitosis to rate."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 2) -

Andrew Ippolito: And i'll play it a few times, you can see it okay so here let's go back here so here so we're going through pro fees right pro Meta fees Meta fees are all lining up.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, right here i'll freeze it, you can see, this chromosome right here is not part of the club right they're not segregating properly.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when the cells divide.

Andrew Ippolito: inversions, as you can imagine, will lead to problems in the next generation when crossing over as a template right normally you want to line everything up like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here watch this if this is the normal chromosome. Andrew Ippolito: If we need to line that up with a chunk that got inverted we would have to do something like this, what really is the best way to do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would have to do a twist to it. Andrew Ippolito: And that's going to lead to additional problems, I have a slide on that in a second Okay, so I said inversion and then Lastly, a translocation just imagine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of crossing over happening between two non homologous chromosomes right if you go to the library imagine taking a whole stack of books from one shelf and just swapping over some random stack somewhere else right the other books are fine they're just in a different location now.\nAndrew Ippolito: The problems, in particular with any chromosomal event, where you have a boundary region.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is there is a chance of this happening. Andrew Ippolito: Okay let's say that this is gene a, and this is gene be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if I if something occurs, where it happens in the middle of an important gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: And let's just make this so let's say G F accidentally got trans located here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see how this gene now is kind of a combination of two genes, this is called a camaro.\nAndrew Ippolito: or kind merrick gene, and that can give rise to a protein product that has mutated we'll talk about those more length when we do genetic mutations that's after."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 2) - Human Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=kef3MQLsVwLsoqgu","chunkTitle":"Philadelphia Chromosome","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the Philadelphia chromosome, a chromosomal abnormality associated with certain types of leukemia.","start":"1:36:10","end":"1:37:03","content":"Andrew Ippolito: or kind merrick gene, and that can give rise to a protein product that has mutated we'll talk about those more length when we do genetic mutations that's after.\nAfter all this.

Andrew Ippolito: Right, so instead of so there's see Ray see the E it's running up this way, so this whole part has been this whole part has been swamped when you go to try.\nAndrew Ippolito: To do crossing over here, you see that right, but think of these like what spaghetti noodles. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so you can now bend them, it was like they're they're playing in bed together spooning basically, you can see their coddling each other here, the idea is, if you track the the red one, you can see, it does this loop right, it does this loop like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you will it allows. Andrew Ippolito: For crossing over to occur, you see, that we can still create remember the there's the synaptic dmo complex would just form this very strange loop, and the problem is is if if crossing over occurred within that area like right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so, in other words, it results in this chromosome a B, C D E, be a right that would be the recombined chromosome right there I just drew a continuous one, and then the other one would be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Hello start here. Andrew Ippolito: and go this way.\nAndrew Ippolito: That gives rise to a B, C D E BA oops right, so, in other words, I have a duplication of DNA here and I have a deletion of the E, F G right this chromosome no longer has F G on it and then this chromosome right has G F C D E, F G right there just totally different guy alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: So this is still like crossing over and, like the first part of my users, but like this would be like a problematic.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah exactly. Andrew Ippolito: And so what this is is this is mom having her problem but it's not too bad, and this is her offspring.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right this this is her egg cell going i'm sorry this is her stem cell becoming an egg cell and having this inversion occur i'm sorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: She inherited this inversion, so this is mom's gino. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, like this is her grandmas and her her mom and dad's each respective chromosome so dad dad's chromosome has this mistake on it Okay, when the mother's eggs recombine that's her eggs now and so her kids right if her kid inherits this illegal they're missing some jeans there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so they'll be emmys I guess for that, whatever that chromosome lucas's great because assume assume that, like let's say this is the egg.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's assume the sperm is normal right so let's say this is normal right, so if we so the two red circles imagine across there right for for gene a there's no gma over here, so they would be hemmings I guess for gina or for Lucas, a right, they would be homies I guess for Lucas be.\nAndrew Ippolito: right for see, they would have they would be normal for D, they would be normal and for actually for this whole chunk they'd be normal okay so everything will be normal except they would just have one copy of a envy okay and and.\nAndrew Ippolito: They actually. Andrew Ippolito: have three copies.\nAndrew Ippolito: For gmm. Andrew Ippolito: So who knows what that's going to cause Okay, sometimes it's just as important, not just to have the healthy gene, but to have the appropriate expression levels of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right imagine a faucet a pair of faucets and you have them on and they're going fine and then just add a new facet, to the sink and turn that one on a full gush too much and sometimes that leads to problems.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright cool. Andrew Ippolito: And then, because we live in the Philadelphia region makes sense, talking about the Philadelphia chromosome, this is a chromosome that causes cancers.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the kind merrick idea, so the tip of chromosome nine trans locates but the tip of chromosome 22.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so chromosome nine gets the extra part of chromosome 22 and then chromosome 22 gets a little chunk chromosome nine here and the key is.\nAndrew Ippolito: The gene that's normally here and the gene that's normally here and up recombining and so you get this kind America gene that has part of chromosome nine and part of chromosome 22 and that gene product just happens to cause cancer.\nAlexis Micewski: Okay, is there any reason why they think this Philadelphia. Andrew Ippolito: that's where I was discovered.\nyeah. Andrew Ippolito: yeah whenever you see odd name things there's always a story behind it, you can probably just Google Philadelphia chromosome and I never learned the history of it, God alexa is it a specific type of cancer cancer, yes yeah, no, no, no, you know what now, I have to know.\nAndrew Ippolito: delphia Roman. Andrew Ippolito: i've learned this like long time ago Okay, here we go Philadelphia chromosome is an abbreviated chromosome 22 that was short changed on a reciprocal exchange material crumbs of nine but Okay, the transaction occurs in a cell in the bone marrow oh causes cml chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\nAndrew Ippolito: A form of it i'm sorry acute lymphoma oh no, no, chronic miles it causes CMO is also found in a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia so they're cml.\nAndrew Ippolito: Their cml that's chronic lymphocytic leukemia and then a ll that's acute lymphoblastic leukemia okay so leukemias are just cancers of the blood and there are the opposite of, say, solid tumors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so look so you have solid tumors and think of cancer growing in your like a like a tumor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's called week what we call those kinds of cancer solid tumors and then there's leukemias okay leukemias don't form masses, they just the key is is the blood cells normally right would grow up let's say this is like a T cell here, and this would be.\nAndrew Ippolito: The stem cell. Andrew Ippolito: looky leukemias are when the stem cells end up mutating and just forming a bunch of immature cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's why we think about your blood cell count, so we do white blood cell counts, if your White blood cell counts are going down.\nAndrew Ippolito: That means that you know normally your White blood cells are dying and they're not getting replaced, and the reason they're not getting replaced is because the cells aren't differentiating they're just dividing and dividing and dividing that's what makes it look.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like it's a leukemia as the accumulation of amateur cells that don't do what they're supposed to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the general idea. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so, in addition to the mutations that can occur within a chromosome, we can also have the abnormal numbers of chromosomes and Montessori and trisomy so now, you can see here's an example of just aneuploidy conditions.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have to memorize this chart, but you can read through this and you can understand it now let me so, for example, if I said."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 13 (Part 2) - Human Genetics","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=kef3MQLsVwLsoqgu","chunkTitle":"Abnormal Structures","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses structural abnormalities in chromosomes, such as Cri du Chat syndrome and fragile X syndrome.","start":"1:44:19","end":"1:48:00","content":"Andrew Ippolito: You don't have to memorize this chart, but you can read through this and you can understand it now let me so, for example, if I said.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's look at here's Turner syndrome so here i'll tell you what i'll put a little dot next to the ones you need to know you've already learned them or work or about to Turner client filter.\nThe Sheen. Andrew Ippolito: cried the child.\nAndrew Ippolito: that those are the ones on this slide anyway so i'll show you now. Andrew Ippolito: over here there's four that are just abnormal promise of number, we got down syndrome client filter X, Y y and Turner syndrome and.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is just the wrong number of chromosomes trisomy 21 three copies of chromosome 21 and I know where at one o'clock so let me just gloss over these really quick right, you can see here the carrier type there's three copies of 21.\nAndrew Ippolito: client filter is having multiple X chromosome and this case, you can see, they have four of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay they're phenotypically male you would say this, they present phenotypically as male. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, but they have particular attributes that are deviant from typical male so inclined filters the genitalia, for example, will have a.\nAndrew Ippolito: hair growth pattern that is distinctly female the V shape instead of the square shape, they will also have slightly enlarged secondary sexual characteristics and they tend to have elongated faces.\nAndrew Ippolito: All of these tend to also be associated with learning disorders go ahead.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, I thought I thought okay all right X, Y y that's having one extra y chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, sometimes it goes Meta mouse.\nAndrew Ippolito: Turner syndrome, I told you about already that's the low. Andrew Ippolito: and female, so they present female.\nAndrew Ippolito: sexually secondary sexual characteristics, they tend to have broad shoulders the thick neck and limb deformities you can see, if you look carefully at this you'll see the toes are slightly deformed and you can kind of see the hands a little deformed there.\nAndrew Ippolito: They can also be flat chested they're there they can have children, though they're fertile Okay, and they have learning disorders.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so that's inappropriate numbers and then the last thing we're going to cover here for human genetics and be done with this is abnormal structures okay so there's cry you would say cried your child it's French for cry of the cat.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is when you're missing the very top portion of chromosome five. Andrew Ippolito: And the reason it's called that is children who are born with this, the bb when it's in in the crib for the first time after it's born when it cries it sounds like a cat mewing.\nAndrew Ippolito: which I assume is very disturbing for parents when they hear. mewing sound instead of a crime.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's that's credit shot and. Andrew Ippolito: that's all i'll say about that and the fragile X is the part of the X chromosome that has just held on by like a really thin thread, and so it tends to fragment very easily.\nAndrew Ippolito: People will try to check like down syndrome have a facial countenance that's a little not countenance I forgot the word to use, but basically there are structural signatures where everybody that has it tends to look similar, just like in down syndrome.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they might look like siblings when in fact they just have the similar. Andrew Ippolito: chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: mutation okay so that's correct.

Andrew Ippolito: invasive testing right so there's non invasive testing, you can do blood tests, you can do ultra ultra sounds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Even though technically ultrasounds not invasive and that you're breaking a body of your cavity or you're not penetrating the skin you're you're sending disrupt the waves of high pitch frequencies into the tissue that's gotta do something right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So briefly and your synthesis is when.\nAndrew Ippolito: We, so we have a developing fetus about 14 to 16 weeks old and it's surrounded by this very thin membrane with that has a fluid.\nAndrew Ippolito: called the amniotic fluid so that's the amniotic the amniotic sac. Andrew Ippolito: And what we do is, we take a needle and we're very you know, using ultrasound guided, we very carefully bring the needle into the womb, and we withdraw a bunch of this float.\nAndrew Ippolito: The fluid contains both then we send our future lightly the fluid contains some cells some fetal cells that we can culture, these are living cells that we can culture and they take a long time they take a few weeks to grow up enough so that we can do a carrier type.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the meantime, we can take the fluid and do some biochemical tests and we can also do additional testing on these petri dish ones.\nAndrew Ippolito: So overall amniocentesis is more comprehensive it's more diagnostic it just takes a long time to do all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you do an amniocentesis if if it's not too concerning but concerning enough, the rate at which.\nAndrew Ippolito: I should say the risk here is that there's a very, very small increase in the chances of spontaneous abortion or miscarriage that but it's it's less than 1%.\nAndrew Ippolito: If there is. Andrew Ippolito: an urgency that needs to be taken into account, we can do what's called CVs we can do this much earlier pregnancy between eight and 10 weeks and.\nAndrew Ippolito: In CVs what we do is, we take a we ask very, very small amount of tissue directly from the placenta, by going up the vaginal canal into the cervix and with the catheter.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we can take these little little bit of cells almost like a biopsy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the benefit here is, we can do an immediate character just just a few hours later, you can know the character.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you could do some biochemical tests, the drawback here is there's less you can do there's fewer test, you can on with this because we don't have access to the amniotic fluid.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the benefit is its immediate and then the other problem is is that it causes a slightly greater increase in spontaneous abortion.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's more than 1% less than 2% so it's still it's still small but you know if you spend if you spend a decade trying to get pregnant every little 1% helps.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's that that's all i'll say about that.

Andrew Ippolito: i'll give you some examples of this soon, but I just want to hit these into your heads of code dominant both phenotypes are expressed okay incomplete dominance.\nAndrew Ippolito: Neither wins it's a compromise it's incomplete Okay, so this is a compromise.\nAndrew Ippolito: This would be like yellow and blue PS making peace right, this would be something in the middle.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'll give you examples of this one, too, so I think so incomplete dominance means there is no dominant of the old code dominance means they are both dominant and so what's dominant means you see the phenotype.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if an illegal is a dominant do, that means you can see it if it's recessive you can't so if they're both dominant and there's no recessive all the all that's kodama it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just makes sense now when you explain it that way okay on multiple allele trade is a trade where there's one gene but there's more than one Leo so there's not just dominant recessive so you know there's like one, two and three.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, lastly, please a trophy is when one gene literally controls another G, like the point of this gene isn't to make an enzyme or to make a pigment or whatever it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Making enzyme to make a picnic it's to make a gene started to make a protein product that literally controls this somehow okay so so well we'll go through the what what could play drums give you example that right, and then i'm sorry oh my God i'm so tired.\nAndrew Ippolito: What I just explained to you is empty spaces. Andrew Ippolito: At be spaces at be static gene control that's one gene controlling others, you know i'm sorry you guys probably just wrote all that down, and you know cross cross how play a trophy and replace that with that be states is the definition was right empty spaces that's down here with Multifactorial.\nAndrew Ippolito: So pre a trophy is when one gene controls many treats okay that's a similar concept, so one gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: Many traits treat one day to trick me okay you've seen it has a big effect.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's a unique factorial men Delia Delia alright Multifactorial genetics, where there's more than one gene involved basically.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that'd be stacy's is when gene a controls GB generally in a negative way generally he was a teenager and she'd be off right so gina has different illegals some of those wheels work, some of them don't you can see how there might be a variation there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay polly genetic inheritance users multiple genes can play one tree, so you have all these genes controlling one tree.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the example that would be like skin color or body body height."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 14 - Chromosomal Inheritance","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=yR5VUphcqGCDthoh","chunkTitle":"Blood Typing and Rh Factor","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the ABO blood typing system and the concept of codominance. He explains how blood typing works and the significance of the Rh factor in blood transfusions.","start":"10:03","end":"15:38","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And lastly, sometimes you've heard the old adage nature versus nurture alright so sometimes the environment plays a role in our our phenotype.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's the basics here this we're going to go through some examples now alright so here's co dominance there's a flower color chameleon.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you know white chameleon read chameleons and if you cross a white and red Community together okay so pure breeding white pure breeding read you don't get.\nAndrew Ippolito: White or red you get a little above okay So you see how the parts that are white or just as white as mom and the parts that are red or just as red as dad or vice versa okay code dominant.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's two phenotypes. Andrew Ippolito: don't look at this as a phenotype.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's two phenotypes in one and the reason I say like that is because when you do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let me just skip ahead really quick when you look at incomplete dominance okay so roses you cross a red rose and a white rose you get a pink rose okay this pink that's a third phenotype.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and it's a phenotype somewhere in the middle here, this is what we used to see is blending it looks like blending right.\nAndrew Ippolito: The differences, and the reason it's not actually blending is, if you take this pink rose and loud self pollinate or cross pollinate to pink roses together you'll get.\nAndrew Ippolito: This to to one or this one to two to one ratio you get red to pink to white of wanted to to walk in other words, each of the genome types has his own phenotype.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so remember the men dalian pattern is 321 right the model hybrid cross this is the 321 phenotype, so this is a violation of the 321 phenotype, this is a one to two to one.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's incomplete dominance for its code darkness now let's go back to kodama through second because there's a very important example our blood typing.\nAndrew Ippolito: is a good example of both co dominant and multiple multiple a lot of traits right so here's here's how blood typing works, we have it's called the HBO system or there's other blood systems and there are other important antigenic markers in our blood, but this is a predominant one.\nAndrew Ippolito: The other one being the rh factor and you're either plus or minus with that, but we'll talk about that briefly at the end of this alright so here's how it works.\nAndrew Ippolito: You got tools right tools, one from you got one from mom and you got one from dad right so here's the gene and either that that'll Leo can either be an A or it can be a B, or it can be an hour.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: One of the ways we do the nomenclature for this is we do a capital I versus a lowercase I and if its capital is in a for it to be all right, this is the way you do it this way, this shows you that the lowercase size, the recessive trait great.\nAndrew Ippolito: capitalized dominant lowercase I. Andrew Ippolito: So this generally associated oh so be being, this would be so using this system, this now, this is more informative This tells us that A and B are functional products of some kind.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right turns out, if this is a red blood so there's a surface marker a surface antigen it's a glycol protein and we call it a or it's be all right, if the gene itself has mutated and it doesn't produce a viable protein product we call that oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so i'll from a person that's oh type blood would look like this. Andrew Ippolito: A person with a type blood would look like this person would be type low, but look like this and a person with a B type blood would have a bunch of them one of you know some of each that's why it's co dominant both A and B are expressed.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so now that you understand that you can mix and match these three wheels right you only get to you get two out of three draw two cards and your three cards right so think about it, you can either be.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let me, let me just to doodle it i'll make it simpler here, you can have two ways, or you can have an A in and oh right, you can have an A and a B or B in a day.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can have a B2B you can have Bo, which is the smelliest one, and you can have oh.\nNice like that joke in there. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so, if you look at these two.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you look at these two both of these will give rise to either the B or the phenotype right you just need one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then these two will give rise to the A, B phenotype.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then only the double O will give rise to the oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK so that's how blood works as for the plus and the minus there's a separate gene controlled by us it's a basic men daily entry this it's called rh stands for was discovered originally Rhesus monkeys so the rh factor.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's ammonium transporter and the red blood cell. Andrew Ippolito: So it sits here and it allows the pumping really allows of pumping of ammonia.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you either got it or you don't so think of it as a classic men deeley and dominant recessive so you know you're either rh positive or negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so you can imagine, due to a big part of square with plus and minus basically So if you know, a woman who is homozygous dominant marries a man who is homozygous recessive right all of her children are going to be dominant right."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 14 - Chromosomal Inheritance","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=yR5VUphcqGCDthoh","chunkTitle":"Immune Response and Rh Incompatibility","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the immune response to the Rh factor and the development of antibodies.

Andrew Ippolito: When you have a mother, who was already negative right so here, let me give you the problem scenario.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have a mother who's rh negative and she marries a man who's rh positive let's say let's say he's dominant for it right, so I you know.\nAndrew Ippolito: Female up here male along the side. Andrew Ippolito: So there's 100% chance that the kids are going to be rh positive her immune system has never seen rh before because she's rh negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so the way this way immunity works is. Andrew Ippolito: When when you're developing in utero and you come up as a baby and you start growing, for the first year or two of life you're basically building out your immune system your T cells T cells your B cells produce these things, called antibodies.\nAndrew Ippolito: And our bodies are these small little proteins made oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: muse whiteboard. Andrew Ippolito: I really want one wrong clicking you lose everything I just wears White for that does not happen, let me just share my screen here.\nAll right, there we. Andrew Ippolito: Go viruses and my other class over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so. Andrew Ippolito: A woman is rh negative like this, she marries a guy that's rh positive right and then so all the kids you can see here.\nAndrew Ippolito: would be positive that's a phenotype positive Okay, so what happens is antibodies and antibody is a protein produced by B cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's it's consists of a chain and a light chain one of each basically you can cartoon or antibody like why.\nAndrew Ippolito: The key is is this region, right here is called the variable region, it is a random shuffling of genes so it's kinda like crossing over but it's happening only and b cells and only in this one genetic region that's really cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so every single be selling your body billions and billions of B cells produces a completely unique and a body that's completely random this is how we're able to defend against the unknown.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so a woman who is born rh negative has an add one more thing to that so when you're born during your development.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, think about the ideas, this is all random that some of those B cells are going to present a bodies that are specific to proteins on in your body that's bad right, and so what happens is during development during the development of your immune system.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your body is killing the B cells that recognized self. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, this is the most important point in immunology we are born with no B cells that recognize self if we are we get autoimmune diseases that's part of what autoimmune diseases are is that we produce antibodies against yourself and aspect right that's why you have inflammatory responses.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: You know, normally get sick, but here let's talk about covert alright so let's say you get exposed to this virus, for the first time.\nAndrew Ippolito: No human has ever been exposed to this virus that's new to the world to novel you know it's an emerging infectious disease and.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, nobody is immune to this thing, nobody has a competent immune response to it, so what happens is you get infected with it, it starts producing viral particles it starts shedding its proteins everywhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your cells are dying from it and so there's some be cell somewhere in your body gets handed this random fragment of the S protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: From the buyers and the beast was like hey I know this it's a random be cell that happens to know this thing, and so that be so goes through some stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it starts dividing and it starts producing massive amounts of itself right lots and lots of mitosis so you have thousands and thousands of new B cells that are all that, be so.\nAndrew Ippolito: That takes about two weeks, this call your primary immune response and after that two weeks is over.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your have a blood your blood is filled with these things that are producing antibodies everywhere thousands per second thousands of banham body molecules per second at its peak and that's the idea of immunity right that's the idea of immune attack is called your adaptive immune cells.\nTaylor Campbell: And like is that kind of why like after you're infected with like coronavirus you can't get it again for a while.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well yeah yeah right that's. Taylor Campbell: Just kind of fighting.\nTaylor Campbell: off even though it's not present so if it were to be present, again, it would just fight it. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so So if you think about just again this I wish I could teach goes.\nAndrew Ippolito: In ology but just briefly here's the amount of antibody in your blood. Andrew Ippolito: You got nothing and then two weeks later, you got a bunch and then slowly it goes down like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so a few weeks later, after the infection you don't have any more antibodies in your blood what you do have are what are called memory be cells so some of those be sales through mitosis round we become memory cells they're not out in the world, doing.\nAndrew Ippolito: antibody production there waiting and your lymph nodes and they're going to sit there and remember, so the next time you get affected.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, then the button the virus starts going through a cycle again your memory cells right oh I got this and they very quickly respond and that's called your secondary immune response, and so what happens there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is you get a very, very fast rapid increase very fast rapid very fast massive increase in antibodies and it the last in your blood for months that's your secondary immune response that's immunity Okay, the problem there's all sorts of ways that.\nTaylor Campbell: Things can. Andrew Ippolito: Be this, though, for example, the virus can mutate, which happens a lot. Andrew Ippolito: very fast. Taylor Campbell: Right like how those different strands how about that.\nTaylor Campbell: stream might not work. Taylor Campbell: For because slightly different. Andrew Ippolito: That means that that initial antibodies not going to.\nAndrew Ippolito: recognize the new St necessarily. Andrew Ippolito: Particularly if. Taylor Campbell: The new strains.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have a problem such that there is protein there spike protein mutated so they're unrecognizable and actually handily enough actually like over here from my Microbiology class lecture.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the spike protein basically looks like, here we go over here see little something the spike proteins little stick stick it out there's so there's an envelope.\nAndrew Ippolito: envelope fires, and so, if the genes that encode for the spike protein of the suddenly changes into a different shape now you're the antibodies that you spend all that time coming up with and making are useless.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you have to go through a whole thing again so that's how you can get reinfected by a difference pain and this is how the flu works influenza is horribly.\nAndrew Ippolito: mutable it mutates regularly so every season every flu season, we have to get a different shot because it's it's always changing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so that's that's the basic status, let me go back to the PowerPoint now all right and.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so the idea is the first when a woman is rh negative okay What that means is her immune system has never seen the orange protein which means she's got antibodies against it right she'll fight it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So her fetus in our body which is always positive is producing this weird protein that it's never seen before now here's the thing the first pregnancy generally is fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: she's developing her immunity immunity to reach the second kid is where the problems start, because now her body mounts a much more powerful secondary response and that's where the kids blood cells are getting is called human like Mr Mrs where the blood cells start getting latest.\nAndrew Ippolito: The good news is we have treatment for now back in the 70s, we learned that if we inject a woman who has this.\nAndrew Ippolito: going on, we can gesture with antibodies to our age and i'm sorry not anti bias, which we can inject here with the antigen itself, and we can basically it's kind of getting allergy shots it tempers the immune response to the orange.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so now we can have children being born with a mom and the kids are different.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can totally blame dad for this.\nAndrew Ippolito: This he's the one that came with his rh positive genes to the mess all right so that's that's an example of code dominance and that's an example of multi electric right."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 14 - Chromosomal Inheritance","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=yR5VUphcqGCDthoh","chunkTitle":"Glutination Test and Universal Donors/Recipients","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the glutination test for blood typing and the concept of universal donors and recipients.

Andrew Ippolito: This is called the human the gluten nation test the idea here is Imagine you had a microscope slide and you put your red blood cells on.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you want to know what your blood type is okay, so what are your possibilities again you have a or B or a B or.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now, imagine imagine, I sprinkle some let's say this is a type blood let's say we know your amino is a type blood, but the test.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it's a type blood imagine, I added antibodies specific to a right What that means is the antibodies in and I stick to the surface of these cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when the antibodies because they're y shaped right they're going to be able to clean to multiple cells and then actually some antibodies from these kind of really cool structures, like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of it like a dust bowl where they can form these advocates so each one of those can bind to a red blood cell okay so look come together, you see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is called a gluten nation our blood does it's not clotting, this is a gluten nation when proteins cause these comps to happen so it's called an inclination.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you get the comps that means you get a positive response that means that's your your blood type so go over here, you can see, this a type blood where's my mouse a type blood.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so you can either get either the genome types and if you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Take so so the body will make anti be antibodies right think about it, if you're a type blood, you know, a you're going to fight be because you don't know be your immune system doesn't know be so that's an A meter so the antibodies me by the body will be an A, B.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and then separately, if you if you did the nation, I say with the nba antibody would see the clotting.\nAndrew Ippolito: This the gluten nation you to the book clumping of the cells, if you treat them with an A and B and a body you won't see anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and actually in my immunology class in college, I remember, now we actually did this, so you take a little finger pinprick little tiny.\nAndrew Ippolito: and get some blood off you put it on a slide and then you have you know little tubes that have a in the beyond that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you add the little antibody to it, and then you look at under the microscope you can see it exactly so you can blood type very easily right so just look at this all right, a B buttle come with both be type global and complex this oh type blood one company.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's that so now, you can see why we have universal donors and receiver So if I have be type law, so I have be positive blood.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so if i'm in a hospital I have blood transfusion and they accidentally put a type blooded me my body's going to a mountain immune response to it and blow it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it's not going to help me in any way right, if I have a B type blood, I can get any blood that would be the universal acceptor right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if I type blood I can't get anybody's blood, except other old pipeline.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, whereas. Taylor Campbell: I can get my. Andrew Ippolito: going to tell you what. Taylor Campbell: We want them to get like the chunky pieces.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay Okay, so if this half right so. Andrew Ippolito: let's so I be type blood, if you put a type blood into my body right, if I have be type blood that means I produce.\nAndrew Ippolito: antibodies in the civic day. Andrew Ippolito: So I kill it right. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Taylor Campbell: So that way okay.\nTaylor Campbell: Okay that's I thought. Taylor Campbell: I don't know. Andrew Ippolito: Well, so this. Andrew Ippolito: here's the thing when you learn this for the very first time, the reason, this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Confusing is rather it's not confusing if you just keep this very firmly in mind that whatever you are, you will fight what's not you.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I am be I will fight a if I am a be I, like everybody if i'm oh I hate everybody okay that's, the key to understanding and knowledge in the basic levels.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you don't really have that in your head, clearly, then you get really confused I be type blood, so that means I have be type antibodies no I mean you don't have be type antibodies.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you shouldn't have be type banner, but if you did you'd be dead, because your blood wouldn't be there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Taylor Campbell: Because it would get a big right like how.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, you got it you got. Andrew Ippolito: It now now and to this, you know you can be a positive or a negative and be positive and be negative and a positive a negative and positive right so so now, the true universal donor his own negative blood and the true acceptor universally accepted as a positive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right a be positive blood can accept any of the other kind of blood type O negative can only accept or negative right and so people who are all negative those are the ones that that are the the blood banks one regularly because that's the kind of blood that everybody can get right.\nAndrew Ippolito: I had a student one semester, many years ago, he was probably like six foot four six foot five and.\nLike. Andrew Ippolito: really big guy huge guy and when I taught all those classes like yeah they love me there i'm on negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: He said one time they took someone's blood out of them, we started getting busy, because if they could take so much blood from him because he was just such a large.\nAndrew Ippolito: person right he wasn't fat, he was just he was just like calc but he was just huge guy and.\nAndrew Ippolito: They would take. Andrew Ippolito: A lot of but they loved it, they give them cookies and in lollipops.\nTaylor Campbell: Oh, it is excessive right. So, again.\nTaylor Campbell: Like I was like recessive is enough. Andrew Ippolito: So there's nothing here's the thing. Andrew Ippolito: That this is, this is a classic example of code dominance, there is no recessive right if you have the illegal for something it will express the key is the old type blood, the reason there's nothing to express, as it turns out the genius mutated.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it doesn't express anything there's no functional protein product. Taylor Campbell: So, like my mom is a type I don't know what my dad is, but my sister has a blood and I don't know what I have.\nAndrew Ippolito: mom Ray so if your mom is oh type blood, that means that she has to be this she's homozygous recessive.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah he's like the test cross. Andrew Ippolito: If your sister is oh type blood that means your dad has to be at least that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so what you are is you are definitely like this is you right now, you don't know what the exes if X is also I that you both type blood if X is a the newbie type Libya.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah they don't bother me their day like my mom always says like that they're like vampires like they're always calling her like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well that's separate that's if she's she could have right now syndrome and be fit like 10 people tend to be very cold, you know because they should eat very fast and.\nAndrew Ippolito: The the female body tends to be cooler than the male body again because it has a smaller density, you know the bones the bones are a little thinner and that's why.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, women always tend to be a little colder than men and that's that's actually why in the workplace, this is actually like a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Gender equality issue. Andrew Ippolito: The the gold standards of OSHA you know the the workplace rules are based on the male body wearing a suit this like so like all the temperatures were established back in like the 1950s.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know men in suits so like you know being know 68 degrees that's terrible for most women.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you don't want it to be 60 degree, because now you're wearing your 18 different layers to work and you're shutting and go, whereas the guys are all fine that's because.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're in our suits and we're bigger, on average, and we are warmer that's also why, when you look at wedding photography weddings in the winner the guys are comfortable and weddings in the summer, the girls are comfortable.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Alexis Micewski: But also, I like young high school guys always wear shorts in the winter and then brag about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know the whole show. Andrew Ippolito: I was there, too, and I was like not not high school, though we weren't allowed to wear shirts.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, my God I lived in like a really repressive area I didn't I wasn't allowed to wear shorts I just realized we we are was like frowned upon in college right yeah that's what deeper winter all the guys wearing shorts now that's because we're stupid.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's just that's a stupid thing that's the whole like I don't want to wear pants it has nothing to do with being able to I guess we're Okay, with it, because we can stay on the cold open our legs don't have extra fat on them were just stupid.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can see that. Andrew Ippolito: And I was there and I could tell you, the only reason I was wearing shorts was it was kind of like.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was almost like a game of chicken with the guys, I think it was like an unspoken game of chicken, we were like who's gonna start wearing pants first off i'm not i'm fine i'm going.\nAndrew Ippolito: out, I want to keep wearing my shorts even though it's snowing and there's three feet of snow on the ground well i'm tougher than you i'm gonna wear my shorts I think that's what it is there's nothing to do with.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're not uncommon professors were of course we're uncomfortable go ahead, Jordan. Jordan Russell: you're going on.\nJordan Russell: a tangent. Andrew Ippolito: that's a little bit of a tangent I agree. yeah.\nJordan Russell: i'm sorry i'm sorry about that. Andrew Ippolito: Was funny. Taylor Campbell: little thought it was funny.\nTaylor Campbell: Yes, thank you. Andrew Ippolito: Thank you Taylor. Taylor Campbell: I need that kind of support everyone. Jordan Russell: hey, no, no, no, it was.\nTaylor Campbell: you're going on a tangent. Andrew Ippolito: Julia Julia. Jordan Russell: It was funny i'm just like i'm just trying to remember what we were talking about before, so I don't have.\nAndrew Ippolito: What I need to tell, to say the word lemon but Julie, apparently, is not here right now.\nJordan Russell: I was thinking about it, but I was just like you know. Andrew Ippolito: All right, you can see lemon you can see. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, I get it, I get it all right here we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: incomplete dominance. Andrew Ippolito: Either phenotype wins that so here's the key this way you can write down and memorize if you need to the header zygote has an intermediate phenotype.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a third phenotype, this is what looks like blending.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.

He also discusses the environmental impact on skin pigmentation and the influence of diet on height.","start":"36:13","end":"46:54","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay EPI stasis this, this is the the idea here one gene controls and other key right and actually i'm going to give you i'm going to give you a.\nAndrew Ippolito: specific example of this, this is a famous example of Labrador retriever the word itself literally means standing upon that so one gene standing on the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: and keeping it down that's the idea there. Andrew Ippolito: We all love dogs right we all love dogs right cat people know says okay you don't have to look dogs understand as it just helps.\nAndrew Ippolito: labradors anybody have a lab. Andrew Ippolito: And the lab people oh there we go see him, he will kind of lab we go.\nSami Jordan: he's a black lab mix with like a pitbull a little bit. Andrew Ippolito: about what color is he.\nAndrew Ippolito: Black black Okay, we got a black lab anybody else any labs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so now i'm going to teach you how how the car works ready i'm going to do as quick I don't want to spend too much time on this there's two genes to jeans right, I said one gene controls and other G, the first gene makes a pigment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that pigment is either black or Brown.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, simple men dalian pattern here black is dominant to brown so we use the beef or black right don't use the beef or Brown.\nAndrew Ippolito: Use capital before black lowercase B for brown Okay, the second gene, I want you to think of the second gene as a machine that delivers the pigments that are made by the cell to the hair follicles it's like a taxi cab.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so think of it like a taxi it's a it's a pigment taxi.\nAndrew Ippolito: And as long as there's a taxi there you can get you can deliver the payload right so we're using he for this, so he is he's a taxi cab that works and lowercase he is a taxi cab with flat tires.\nAndrew Ippolito: is broken can't do its job right, so you can understand that the only way. Andrew Ippolito: That you can see that phenotype is the lowercase a lowercase right so that's another dominant tree i'm sorry that's another simple dominant recessive concept.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you got two things going on here, on one hand, the cells, making a pigment is either black or Brown and on the other, is getting that pigment or is not getting that pigment to the to the hair alright, so you can see now, you can picture there's a hair follicle.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and at that hair follicle has black pigment and it's black or if it's got brown pigment it's brown or if it doesn't have pigment it is perceived as yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so yellow lab is actually a lab that has no pigment in his hair.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is not albinism For those of you are really. Taylor Campbell: blonde hair works and like people right this.\nAndrew Ippolito: This thing, people are. Andrew Ippolito: All of the i'm sure we probably have pigment deposition mechanisms to but and that's probably why.\nTaylor Campbell: Some people have blonde hair actually. Andrew Ippolito: The blonde hair is probably the result of this kind of mutation. know.\nAndrew Ippolito: The lack of pigment right. alexa. Alexa Deprisco: So at this stage is like turn on a gene expression or not funny.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you would say. Andrew Ippolito: So in this case here, but I just painted for. Andrew Ippolito: You you would say that gene a or gene one here is under EPI static control of gene to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay gene to that so here's how it works that works let's go let's go to the slide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you got the sulfur color is either black or brown right capital be lowercase B and then you have the pigment deposition gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: you either have the ability to deposit the pigment into the hair so plus pavement for you don't have the ability to to that minus sorry so here's the key.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you can't deposit the pigment. Andrew Ippolito: it's gonna be yellow, no matter what it doesn't matter that the genetics, give us black or brown we can't get it there, we can't see it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so, if you look, for example at capital B capital be lowercase a lowercase E rate, so you do a diver across the classical di habra cross that should give you the 9232321 and you don't get 9232321.\nAndrew Ippolito: You get a different ratio right so just just look at this one genotype capital B capital B would be black but lowercase lowercase C means there's no pigment deposition.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they're yellow. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, whereas lowercase lowercase B would give us brown but lowercase a lowercase C would give us yellow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right yellow means the only time you see yellow is because we have no picnic that's the key here.\nAlexa Deprisco: Right, so, if you look. Andrew Ippolito: Good good. Alexa Deprisco: I was going to. Alexa Deprisco: Show them like does it always happen and I guess that's not like a broad generalization that we could always happen that like a gene will turn a gene on or off or like a gene will express gene or not I guess that make sense, like.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's not always raised, so this is only one we see. Andrew Ippolito: EPI static gene control.\nAndrew Ippolito: In other words, not every gene is controlled by other genes necessarily.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right like mendel's plant, the gene that gave rise to that one enzyme to break down chlorophyll or not there's not another gene that controls that gene that that we that we know of anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is that what your question was like do we always see this, this is. Andrew Ippolito: This is just something we've discovered.\nAlexa Deprisco: I guess like the question is like as the space is like. Andrew Ippolito: Oh yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yes. Andrew Ippolito: yeah. Absolutely yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: That that's a that's a good analogy it's like a switch right So if you have the the double lowercase E Loki if you're homozygous recessive for the second gene there.\nAndrew Ippolito: you've that's the switch being off, you know it's called walking into a room that's got a nice art exhibit where every piece of arts read, but the lights are out so it's black.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah alright so that's a piece basis and that's Labrador retriever and that's the last complex model Union factorial concept.\nAndrew Ippolito: polly genetic inheritance, this is history i'm just going to run through these slides more than one g. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so our skin pigmentation is informed by I think there's eight jeans and each gene is either on or off each gene either producer doesn't produce a pigment right and so so think of it like.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can think of your skin tone as a bunch of those little buttons you got on your touch screen on your phone.\nAndrew Ippolito: That, if you touch them they look like this, or this right, so you can turn them all on you have dark skin from all off you have white skin or you can mix and match, and you have all the variations that are skin tone okay so so it's a spectrum.\nOkay. Jordan Russell: They are so like potatoes. Andrew Ippolito: that's the key though I mean right there's only a certain number.\nAndrew Ippolito: of skin tones there's just a lot of them. Andrew Ippolito: And then each one you can be tan or not, you know that's another layer of complexity, if I go out to the sun, for example, if I you know I used to work at the beach when I was in high school and in college and.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know if I spent an entire you know, for four weeks in the sun, I would get like just not brown but that's not my skin my skin tone is whatever this Pasty color is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because I haven't been out the sun regularly for a while, though okay so there's there's that that's an example of where the environment can also play a role right all right guy George.\nJordan Russell: I was gonna say like like with that analogy of how you said, like you can turn it on and off it like reminds me of.\nJordan Russell: This video of this dude showing like the sky. Jordan Russell: Like the pigment lemon cells in like a squid and how they can turn on and off so it's like.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah so it was on a squid color those things are actually.\nAndrew Ippolito: The skin of a cephalopod has these special cells called chromatic force, where they have muscles around them, and if they squeeze the muscles a little.\nAndrew Ippolito: This the cell basically balloons out as the color it hasn't it and so that's why they can instantaneously change their skin color because it's muscle control.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's controlled by not an autonomic response, they don't have conscious control over it necessarily.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and even more ironically, as far as we're aware they're they're colorblind and despite the fact that they're colorblind they can still blend in with their environment perfectly, including the colors and that's one of the great mysteries of cephalopods okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah cephalopod one of the coolest animals on the bitters closest we get the Aliens because their brains as smart, as they are and they're very smart.\nAndrew Ippolito: their brains involved 100% independently of the mammalian brain complete example of convergent evolution their neuron complexities are absolutely different, they have a different history, the nurse, and yet they can still do very similar things enters.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, anyway, so that's that okay environmental impact hydrangeas are an example of a flower that has a very significant environmental role so red hydrangeas vs blue hydrangeas and you know what I want to finally get this right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Read one of them is low pH one of these is high pH red vs blue hi grant.\nAndrew Ippolito: Writing let's see okay blue is. Andrew Ippolito: The cynic.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here. i'll go.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then so.\nAndrew Ippolito: see where it. Andrew Ippolito: Is a blue southern Okay, so this is a hold on. Alexa Deprisco: This is South, and this is North okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So in the north, we tend to have read hydrangeas because our soils more acidic and the north and the south, they have blue hydrangeas they tend to be i'm sorry we have more alkaline soil and the north there's more acidic soil in the south right God what was I.\nAlexa Deprisco: See monkey. Is that one. Alexa Deprisco: The monkey.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you say see monkey. Andrew Ippolito: Is that OK me a second cuz you're talking about that I think so yeah."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 14 - Chromosomal Inheritance","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=yR5VUphcqGCDthoh","chunkTitle":"Genetics Lecture: Phenylketonuria (PKU)","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) caused by a mutation in the PAH gene.

What. Taylor Campbell: shrimp shrimp. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, it's type.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of. Andrew Ippolito: career life and it says that's a sea monkey apparently. Taylor Campbell: know they eat shrimp.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, you eat shrimp how. Taylor Campbell: Well, they do. Andrew Ippolito: They do, though, yeah well the a lot of things, the last shellfish.\nTaylor Campbell: But that's why they think. Andrew Ippolito: Well that's, no, no. Andrew Ippolito: They also ED I mean really most arthropods have that pigment in them so yeah and there's the shrimp actually right that color that you see.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the cooked color. Andrew Ippolito: Right in nature, they look. Taylor Campbell: very ugly and gross.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, yes, they are. Andrew Ippolito: i've had somebody told me that they would can't eat shrimp because they're basically like the the bugs of the sea, yes insects, but.\nTaylor Campbell: they're so good, I love I love that correct yeah. yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, you see the little Q bunnies now. Andrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: there's an enzyme that makes a pigment the pigments black, but the enzyme is very delicate I call it like a snowflake enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this is the enzyme right, even if it just gets a little warm it just falls apart Okay, and so this is called a temperature sensitive mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if you take these bunnies and you rear them you raise them at very cold temperatures under 20 degrees Celsius.\nAndrew Ippolito: You will see these cute little bunny knows and it's cute little bunny ears and this cute little bunny tail and has little feet, because they'll pause there all black because those are the parts of the body that are the coldest.\nAndrew Ippolito: As you know, if you're out in the winter right your ears of the first get cold and your cold hands and your nose gets cold that's because those are the areas that are the thinnest membranes closest capillaries directly to the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas if you raise that say so, think of a clone of that bond in these are clones of each other tonight, a technical writers raised it above 30 degrees Celsius You see, none of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so those that phenotype is not genetic that's due to the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And lastly, identical twins if you separate them at birth and you give them completely different diets they will have different heights so our Heights are actually informed in part by our genes and also our diet.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is why, if you ever go to a museum and you look at medieval clothing and suits of Armor from the knights you'll notice that those suits of Armor look like they belong to a bunch of you know, like teenagers they're like five foot two five foot three.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's because that was the average height back then, because we have poor diet poor nutrition.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's why immigrants and refugees from third world countries that were raised environments of poor nutrition tend to be very short but their children once they're here and they're fed the traditional American diet, or just told anybody else go ahead alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: I sort of quickly tangent because he did say at one point earlier on in the lecture that like we could run like dumb fast in the past.\nAlexa Deprisco: But like yeah so we're too late. Alexa Deprisco: Well, their correlation there. Andrew Ippolito: No, no, we were short, if we don't eat well.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're fast if we're not fast, but we used to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah that's there's I mean you know I imagine early humans did not have you know the best nutrition either right so i'm sure that.\nAndrew Ippolito: In any you know wild setting humans were probably you know average height five foot two five foot one you know, whereas you know high fructose corn syrup from birth and here you are a five foot eight now.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah. Andrew Ippolito: All right, and then play a trophy one gene many treats there's one human disorder that I want you to know, and this is so, this you can lump this and what the human stuff from earlier, the human genetic stuff it's called female ketone area or pk.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this isn't mutation caused by one gene it's called pH PA the party Fino alanine hydroxyl is it's an enzyme that breaks down the amino acid field.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then normal people people that don't have the mutation right so, by the way this diagram down here pay attention to what i'm going to say, because when I first I stole it from the Internet from some website on the disease.\nAndrew Ippolito: is so confusing in and really I should replace this so here's the idea, because you see the blue arrow that means it's normal, so the normal phenotype is you take the final alanine you break it down and it comes out, as you know, useful chemicals carbon dioxide and water right.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you mutate this. Andrew Ippolito: mutated you can't break it down and instead Fino alanine builds up in the body is feeling like acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that causes the disease female ketone Eric and if you know, keep doing your leads to severe mental retardation reduce hair and skin pigmentation and it's lethal if it's not treated so.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is one of those diseases that we can when when the kid first gets born and we run those little barrage of tests if they find that the mutation in the PKU gene the gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then that kid can grow up so long as they have a restricted diet that has very, very low levels of Fino alanine.\nAndrew Ippolito: They can be completely normal, and this is why, when you look at the back of some of the food products or GM packs particularly diet stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: aspartame is a Fino alanine derivative and so you'll see something that's a warning pharmacogenetics contains Fino alanine one farm go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let me just show you a very quick picture here of what i'm talking about you've seen this label.\nAlexa Deprisco: Excuse me. Alexa Deprisco: yeah so Fino alanine is like a classic sugars them.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no it's sweet, but it is the only reason why we perceive it as sweet as it triggers the same receptors that sugars do, but it is peptide based.\nAndrew Ippolito: There you've seen this before me show you a copy image.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, you've you've all seen female ketone eric's contains been allowing and that labels there for people with this disease.\nThat now you know. The more you know.\nTaylor Campbell: rainbow Okay, is that only in diet soda. Andrew Ippolito: Well, no it's anything that has.\nAndrew Ippolito: A. Taylor Campbell: aspartame aspartame.\naspartame.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah here. Andrew Ippolito: here's your description aspartame is an official an artificial non saccharine gosh it's of course it's got to be in a white there.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a non saccharine Sweden or 200 times sweeter than sucrose and commonly use a shirt blah blah blah it's a methyl ester of the spark acid Fino alanine di peptide alright, so you take a spark acid Fino alanine sticking together and then and then Esther.\nAndrew Ippolito: make a methyl ester of that organic chemistry ninja ninjutsu and you get something that smell tastes 200 times sweeter that's why those packets only have this a little bit of it in there because it's just so ridiculously sweet.\nApril Neeld: Outside outsides of weird aftertaste I don't like pressure cause cancer, too, and my."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 14 - Chromosomal Inheritance","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=yR5VUphcqGCDthoh","chunkTitle":"The Cheap and Easy to Grow","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the problem of the lack of naturally occurring mutations and the challenges faced in finding them.","start":"58:46","end":"58:54","content":"Andrew Ippolito: The cheap and easy to grow, the problem is there aren't a whole lot of.\nAndrew Ippolito: naturally occurring mutations.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so here here would be the male.\nAndrew Ippolito: Female okay so let's let's say that um. Andrew Ippolito: So, so in fruit fly genetics, the way we name the illegals with a lot is we use we we don't pick the letter of dominant trait that's what men and.\nAndrew Ippolito: What Morgan did was he picked the letter of the mutant right, so in this case we use lowercase w for for white Chris the white color was the new color and then we would say either a little plus.\nAndrew Ippolito: or nothing at all. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so the females would be this.\nAndrew Ippolito: The mail would be this. Andrew Ippolito: Little plus denotes but we called wild type.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the naturally occurring. Andrew Ippolito: Wild type.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So when you do this cross right the female can only contribute a single Leo great job w plus the malveaux can either give us the X with the mutant Roi.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so 5050 male female, of course, right. Andrew Ippolito: So the females would be w plus w so the plus goes first, just like the capital letters go first and then the males will be w plus.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, this would be. Andrew Ippolito: This would be the ones right under percent read so that that would be expected.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then he allowed these the Cross so it's a cross up so you have a red eyed male.\nAndrew Ippolito: crossed with. hoops. Andrew Ippolito: A wide eyed female but she is a carrier.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so when you map this cross out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you get females. Andrew Ippolito: That are red eyed females that are red eyed.\nAndrew Ippolito: males that are red eyed and males that are ya.\nGood. Alexa Deprisco: So w plus the wild type is red eyes and then just w is like the meeting type rate yes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's your 321 read the white.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this would be the F 2321.

Andrew Ippolito: Right so here's here's what the experiment actually you're not going to see all this right what you're actually going to see.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is you're going to see this this fruit fly growth Chamber, which is a basically a glass file like this it's got this kind of weird food stuff in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's like it's kind of like this color. Andrew Ippolito: And then, it has a nice foam Cork in the top.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and so you're just you see in there, and you just see a bunch of flowers crawling around. Andrew Ippolito: Right, and so what we do is we anesthetize them, we take a tube and we pump a bunch of carbon dioxide in there that knocks him unconscious.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we have this little device it's looks like a it's like a sponge almost like a big of just a little cardboard pad but.\nAndrew Ippolito: The top of it is porous and there's a little tube on the side here that we can pump.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon dioxide into so basically carbon dioxide is able to come up here like this, and so we pour the unconscious flies on to this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we can look at them under the dissenting scope and we can you know you with a little us a little paint brush so they don't hurt them and we can just look at them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's how, and then we have a little clicker in her hands, and we can count the number of files that are white I didn't read it, and all that Okay, so you have.\nAndrew Ippolito: You took again so you took a wide eyed now you crossed it with a red eye female.\nAndrew Ippolito: That gave you. Andrew Ippolito: 100%.\nAndrew Ippolito: males and females right parental F1.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then. Andrew Ippolito: When you let those cross in the F two.\nAndrew Ippolito: You saw. Andrew Ippolito: A three to one ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: But you saw those are groups.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the males were 5050. Andrew Ippolito: And the females were 100 hundred percent.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what do we need to cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the F to. Andrew Ippolito: To make an F3 that gives us.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whatever else, it is, we want a white female.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you right now, you have a stock of F two flaws. Andrew Ippolito: And you have a whole bunch of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and this F to this isn't a single container. Andrew Ippolito: And there's you know 60 flaws in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And 25% of them are wide eyed and 75% of them are red eyed.\nAndrew Ippolito: And all the red eyed ones are female. Andrew Ippolito: and half of the red ones are male.\nAndrew Ippolito: ratio should say all of the red eyed flies.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're male and females in there, and the only ones that are in there that are wider mail so who am I crossing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you see the problem. Andrew Ippolito: almost like a test cross all those read it flies in there right if I just handed this file to you bought this on craigslist.\nAndrew Ippolito: How do you know which ones of those females are true breeding for read if.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't and so here's what you do here's, this is the solution to that you do a bunch of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to pull it just randomly i'm going to take 12345678 now i'm going to take 10 tubes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'm going to put a red eyed female into every single one of those tubes and i'm going to put one of the wide eyed males and every single one of those oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Now, as a reminder, if we go back to the point of square here.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we look at this carefully those red eyed females are either.\nAndrew Ippolito: This gino type. Andrew Ippolito: or this gino type is 5050.\nAndrew Ippolito: So statistically speaking, if I did this 10 times five of those tubes would have one of these in it and five of those tubes will have this in it.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: So let me go back here.\nIf. Andrew Ippolito: The female was this OK, so the mail is always this rate is basically This is basically like 10 test crosses so that would be one setup.\nAndrew Ippolito: This would be the other setup right, and of course you got the why.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not writing i'm leaving out the X chromosome here. Andrew Ippolito: But the idea here is this let's forget the mail let's just think of the females that's what we're going for alright 50% of the time we're going to get.\nAndrew Ippolito: 100% right right so so we would expect of these 10 test tubes five of them are going to give us always 100% read females.\nAndrew Ippolito: The other side.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna see 5050 raise your hand that made sense so make sure you're keeping up with me okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: questions."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 14 - Chromosomal Inheritance","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=yR5VUphcqGCDthoh","chunkTitle":"Linkage and Independent Assortment","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the concept of linkage and how genes on the same chromosome can affect the independent assortment of traits.","start":"1:14:49","end":"1:29:01","content":"Andrew Ippolito: questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so morgan's team did this experiment, and this is exactly what they saw.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and this is science right here, this is pure science. Taylor Campbell: empiricism. Andrew Ippolito: Go ahead tell her.\nTaylor Campbell: Did they get a white female or where they are now. Andrew Ippolito: nope they so it was 5050.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the FDA this is really, this is the F3 progeny so in the F3. Andrew Ippolito: When they ran 10 F2 crosses.\nAndrew Ippolito: 50% of the time those crosses with the old what 5050 wide eyed red eyed females and 50% of the time, and they would just get red eyed view, which is exactly what was predicted by their model.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so that science there's there's empirical observations empiricism combined with rationalism being able to reason your way through it, and so this here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This while we just came across here did two things for Morgan, and this is what put him on the map, when he published this finding he was able to show.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sex linkage, in other words, he was able to show that there were genetics underlying the X chromosome but, more importantly, he was able to finally.\nAndrew Ippolito: identify. Andrew Ippolito: The mystical factors of mental and he was able to say that, whatever the factors were that mental referred to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Wear these discrete regions of a chromosome. Andrew Ippolito: called jeans I don't think Morgan came up with the phrase gene, but this is where they started talking about the gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: And gene theory the gene theory of inheritance, instead of just calling it the particular theory right, so this is what more and in the publication, he would say here's the X chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that X chromosome somewhere on that X chromosome was a gene Lucas.\nAndrew Ippolito: That either had a red oops a red eye variant.\nAndrew Ippolito: or a wide eyed variant.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that was the first big thing Morgan. Andrew Ippolito: And now, what i'm about to say this is where things get complicated.\nAndrew Ippolito: So before we even go on from here, you need to ask me questions, to make sure that you can go on to the next concept any questions here.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's nothing we haven't that nothing here should be complicated if you've been doing your genetics homework and your understanding, all this nothing there's nothing here we're just extending which you already understand.\nTaylor Campbell: So um we found out from the first i'm breeding like from that the parent that into F1 that the red eye is dominant to the mirror.\nTaylor Campbell: So the reason why we found the the males to have white eyes more frequently than female in that F to progeny was because they only have that one X chromosome so it only needed one to have that, and the reason they struggle to get that with the female was because they needed to write.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is a perfect understanding. Okay. Taylor Campbell: Good.\nAndrew Ippolito: So remember when we learned mental we talked about, we did the model hybrid stuff right, and then we had the whole or what about a second G the tiles on the shorts and the yellows and Greens right, what was the relationship between different genes and so Morgan, then.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, he was modeling his series of experiments after mental right, so the next step here.\nAndrew Ippolito: is to ask the question what's the relationship between two genes and so, for this series of experiments, I want to use my PowerPoint because I actually map this out.\nAndrew Ippolito: I said okay in your textbook your textbook has a lot of very complex nasty fingers and diagrams at this point that if you if you read ahead and you tried to outline it all, it was probably overwhelming.\nAndrew Ippolito: visually it's just a nightmare right because they're just so much information there, so what i'm going to do for you right now is, I took the textbooks example.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of the hybrid cross essentially. Andrew Ippolito: And I distilled it into much simpler terms that you can see, on the screen here so i'm going to walk you through this okay so we're in your studying in the future.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're going through this this has crossed and it's not making sense you've come back to this video and watch the segment again okay so i'm going to try to do this on one interrupt one uninterrupted little two minutes all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's this setup we have two trades body color wing size.\nAndrew Ippolito: Body color is either black or Gray. Andrew Ippolito: The natural wild type version is a Gray body and the mutant is a black body so we're going to use the be that represents black right and so B plus would be Gray.\nAndrew Ippolito: And B would be black. Andrew Ippolito: All right, so so this would be the natural version that they find in nature, this would be the mutant.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: wing size, you can have normal size wings, or you can have this digital wing best digital means it lost its original function basically there's their miniaturized so these flies can't fly.\nAndrew Ippolito: which begs the question, what do we call them. Andrew Ippolito: let's call them walks.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we help flies and what's alright, so this digital wings vg that's the.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the standard for wing size right so big positive means you have normal size wings and vg means you just have you have little little tiny wings you can't find.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so what you can think of here as we're going to take. Andrew Ippolito: Right so so a wild type fly would be right B plus B plus B plus B G plus right so that's that's their generic life find out in nature, and then the mutant would have to be this, because these are all recessive genes that's important.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so he didn't just find these in nature, he bred these things over the years this took a while to establish right, and so, at one point in time, the the Columbia fly lab was famous it was a world famous.\nAndrew Ippolito: genetics lab and you can imagine walking into a room filled with cupboards filled with little vials of flies that all had identifying marks on it that basically had these kinds of labels on them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so so any researcher can come in and mix and match and do crosses.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: This is also you can see.\nAndrew Ippolito: I just leave it at that, so the, this is the Rentals right, those are the printers.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to cross them. Andrew Ippolito: And we're gonna get while we expect.\nAndrew Ippolito: grey bodied normal winged fly. Andrew Ippolito: What we're going to do, then, is what's called Oh, I mean it's a test cross right we're gonna we're gonna take.\nAndrew Ippolito: The. Andrew Ippolito: The dye hybrid here. Andrew Ippolito: Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to cross that it's also called the back cross when you take an F1 your cross it back to a parent because remembering and flies don't care.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we're going to take the original mutant right the homozygous recessive for both traits. Andrew Ippolito: are going to cross that with F1 that's a test cross but it's also for the BAT cross because we're pulling it from the previous generation.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words we're going to do this cross we're going to use a B plus B vg plus vg.\nAndrew Ippolito: crossed with the homozygous recessive right, and the reason for that is the number of unique illegals this one can make it simple right.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's just be vg that's the gamut phenotype both do you know it's simple one, whereas this one's gonna have all four right you remember the foil method so so our.\nAndrew Ippolito: planet square here really are upon a rectangle is going to look it's going to be a four by one right all four of the different combinations here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not here I haven't I haven't mapped out over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here here's here's the hair the gametes crossed to the test cross.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so let's let's reason our way through the possibilities.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we would expect if if fruit flies behave like P plans we would expect.\nTo see. Andrew Ippolito: One of each of the phenotypes so let's just refresh our memories were the phenotypes we agree body body we got normal wings and vestigial things so we would expect to see right here, what would the phenotype of that one be let's see if we're all on the same page.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the phenotype of that fly.\nAlexa Deprisco: Like to wild play exactly. Andrew Ippolito: Gray body. Normal me. Andrew Ippolito: Right, what about this fly.\nTaylor Campbell: Body normal when. Taylor Campbell: you're.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's homozygous recessive right. Andrew Ippolito: yeah so that'd be. Taylor Campbell: Best digitally.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's so the mutant is vestigial and that would give us the mutant phenotype so this would be 100% new.\nAndrew Ippolito: What about this one.\nJordan Russell: This digital wings and a was it black body or is a great body.\nAndrew Ippolito: For what while temper me. Andrew Ippolito: Remember that the letter is taken from the mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the be tells us that black is the mutant and therefore grey is wild type so is that Gray or black.\nJordan Russell: it's Gray. Andrew Ippolito: Good it's. Jordan Russell: Just digital wings. Andrew Ippolito: You got it. Jordan Russell: Great vestigial and then what's this one.\nAndrew Ippolito: be the opposite right be black and normal.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here's here's the key here's one of the little secret stylist notice that, for the ones that have.\nAndrew Ippolito: The recombinant phenotypes. Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: That. Andrew Ippolito: You get one parental in one recombinant or one recombinant one parental right so you're either the wild type for one trait I mean for the other or your immune for the one treat and recommit for the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the idea here right the idea here is that these two phenotypes these two geno types we're going to call these the recombinant ones.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because again they have one treat from mom and one treat from dead they don't look like either mom or dad.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are a combination of both whereas these are the perennials.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's right i've introduced that concept, a couple times now, this is where the payoff is this is where it's very important to understand this now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so does that make sense, the idea of the parental phenotypes the parental genotypes very competent was OK, so when they map this out conceptually before doing the Cross they would expect to see.\nAndrew Ippolito: Even representation across the board eyeball them if the genes for the two treats are on different chromosomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so let's just think about here's chromosome one chromosome to chromosome three chromosomes X or y and let's say that the trainer chromosome 123 and then let's say you know X or y doesn't matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then we have the body color okay so so be let's say that the gene for body color is here, and then gene for vestigial missus over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, can we all agree that if those genes are where those are when we go through meiosis and crossing over and all that jazz.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to see independent assortment right we're going to be able to produce all the various combinations right so here here's the deploy.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say that this is the header is like it. Andrew Ippolito: So that's the visual representation of the genome, of the dye hybrid.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you can see, when we go through meiosis there right, we can get the below with the vga Leal we can get the B, plus a Leo with the vg illegal.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or we can get the be aaliyah with the vg plus or we can get the B plus with the big puzzle all for possible combinations are there because of independent assortment right you guys with me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what is the same ideas that tall shorts in the yellow green. Andrew Ippolito: Right we're sitting here, assuming that the genes for each of those traits are on different chromosomes if they're on different chromosomes we're going to have crossing or i'm sorry we're going to have independent assortment occur.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that all possible combinations of gametes can be made.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right remember so each one of these is a ganymede gino type.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, ask me questions here because it's just going to get more complicated.\nAndrew Ippolito: alexa you look confused and that worries me. Alexa Deprisco: So if they're on the same chrome is them you wouldn't be as much variation in the Gambia."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 14 - Chromosomal Inheritance","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=yR5VUphcqGCDthoh","chunkTitle":"Summary and Conclusion","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito summarizes the key concepts discussed and emphasizes the importance of understanding linkage in genetics.","start":"1:29:01","end":"1:31:21","content":"Andrew Ippolito: alexa you look confused and that worries me.

Andrew Ippolito: So you get that. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so now now will do what you just said, to what, if I did this, what if I took that gene from chromosome three and I moved it over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, am I going to get independent assortment no i'm always going to get either be vg or B plus vg plus right I can't get be big plus or big B.\nAndrew Ippolito: b plus vg I can't get those because they're on the same chromosome i'm going to get this it's all or nothing forget crossing over forget crossing over just think of the fact that they're on the same chromosome right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay linkage that we call this linkage. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so if the genes are on the same chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would expect this ratio. Andrew Ippolito: Here, forget this, we would expect if these two genes for for body color and for.\nAndrew Ippolito: wing size, if they were on the same chromosome we would expect to never see those recombinant phenotypes.\nAndrew Ippolito: That would just be zero, we would do the Cross we would see the actors and we would see only Gray body normal or black body vestigial and that's it just like mom and dad we would never meet someone in a one to one ratio.\n5050. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so before we forget again forget crossing over they didn't know what that was back then they barely understood meiosis right, so these were the only two worlds of possibilities for the researchers doing this cross.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, their hypothesis led to a model prediction, and so, when they did the Cross they didn't get either of those."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 14 - Chromosomal Inheritance","link":"https://youtu.be/Kut8pfDXe80?si=yR5VUphcqGCDthoh","chunkTitle":"Introduction","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the significance of introducing stress into the environment for evolution to happen.

Andrew Ippolito: i'm sorry i'm sorry it's got an end up to how do I know that there's you look here there's two visually distinguishable types of chromosomes there's a big one, and all that all.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right this chromosome here is different than this chromosome here so there's two so that's an animal.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's three copies of each this is three n equals six so that's a triple itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this cell here again it has an enemy to.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it has three chromosomes. Andrew Ippolito: So this is a two and minus one.\nAndrew Ippolito: I see that because there should be one here that's missing.\nAndrew Ippolito: This, so this is a half Point seven and three easy peasy there was a three different visually distinguishable chromosomes and then this here, this is an end of three, and this is a two n equals six.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this is a traditional deployed so. Andrew Ippolito: So, if this was a normal body solved, we would say this is, this is the point number right.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is you floyd. Andrew Ippolito: This would be you ploy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because those all look normal, this is the one that's on your pipe because there's something wrong with it.\nOkay. All right.

Andrew Ippolito: Where DNA in the cell was composed of these four letters in a standardized unit, etc, etc, and so he proposed this model here now to be fair, he got the sugar phosphate backbone right actually.\nAndrew Ippolito: He got the sugar phosphate you know the phosphate I asked her bonds that linkedin nucleotides together.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that was it and so Jenny was a boring molecule.

Andrew Ippolito: So he we kind of reached through time and we have a familiar kind of emotional reaction here, the world is sick and we're racing for a vaccine.\nAndrew Ippolito: So he was now he was working instead of with a virus, he was working with a bacterium the streptococcus pneumoniae pneumoniae.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and when he did his work he published a paper in 1928 that was very curious.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because Fred Griffith was a very conservative careful detail oriented microbiologist people knew him, he was he was famous at the time, because he was just so good at his job.\nAndrew Ippolito: He was known he worked in a lab that hardly had any funding and he was able to do this amazing work with, but basically spitting sealing wax.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like his his sterile technique was second to none, he was really good at you know, making sure things didn't get contaminated, which was everything in Microbiology right now, this is important back then right so 1900.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea in Microbiology was if you had a bacterium a bacterial cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it was fixed there was no, you know let's call this you know, whatever this was streptococcus pneumoniae.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whatever there's a cell and and this stream of it was very.\nAndrew Ippolito: very violent means it cause sickness Okay, and so we're gonna so they call the stream the stream.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason they call it s was when you grew on a petri dish it formed these very nice round smooth colonies.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that was a stream there was another stream of pneumonia that was not there was a very.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was harmless. Andrew Ippolito: And when you grew that on a petri dish the.\nAndrew Ippolito: colonies were very rough looking they were messy so we call this the our stream.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so so people who are dying of pneumonia when we do the autopsy and we recover the bacterium from their lungs, that would be s right and we also identified a laboratory strain for our okay so there's a safe strain and the Nazi upstream.\nAndrew Ippolito: So as part of his work he needed an animal model to perform experiments to develop a vaccine and so he used mice that's the most common one of the most common might animals, even today, to use so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So just think you take a healthy mouse, and you infected with the S kind of the strain the mouse eventually gets sick and dice.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you recover from its body some bacterium and you look on the petri dish and sure enough it's the same bacteria, these are called koch's postulates if you take Microbiology koch's postulates is the idea of how do you identify a.\nAndrew Ippolito: microbe that causes the disease right in order to prove its this microbe this is how you do it right so up the animal sick.\nAndrew Ippolito: You recover some bacteria from it, you take a pure colony of it a pure culture of it so like you know scoop one of these off and put in another petri dish so you have just just that one pure species.\nAndrew Ippolito: put that into a healthy animal that I don't get sick and dies, and you recover the same bacteria from that that's how you prove that that infectious diseases caused by that back to him and So here we go okay so.\nAndrew Ippolito: He is trying to create a vaccine right now, at this point louie pastore has already shown how to create vaccinations.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea is is you try to develop either a living version of the bacterium that is harmless, which is what the our stream would be and you do that by passing it through animals that survive survive survive and eventually you mutate it to the point where you get a.\nAndrew Ippolito: An a very old version of it The thing is, is that necessary I don't know if the Austrian actually turned out to be a good vaccine or not I don't know the vaccine side of the story.\nAndrew Ippolito: I just know that DNA stuff so so anyway he's doing this, this this kind of work where he's trying to develop a vaccine so here's what he does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so there's the slide that shows you, the S versus the are all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's all here, I do a little spoiler alert the reason why the stream was dangerous was it turns out that bacterium had.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's the cell. Andrew Ippolito: It had a nice thick.\nAndrew Ippolito: code around it called a capsule.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that capsule protected the cell from being destroyed by the immune system okay it's like Armor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now we know about DNA so i'm gonna i'm going to cheat a little bit here, instead of leading you through this like he did i'm going to give you.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reality of it, there was a there was a little ring and DNA in there, so here's the genome right there's the genome, of the bacterium and then there's a small little piece of DNA called a plasmid.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's learn about these today a plasma is a small ring of DNA that holds a few genes on.\nAndrew Ippolito: It gets replicated along with the rest of the bacteria's DNA, and it goes along with okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so the S version of this had that little plasmon the our version liked it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it didn't have a capsule wasn't protected it could get eaten by the immune system and so that's why it was a very sways harmless.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: We all, we all clear on this, so for you go ahead alexa.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're the type bar so has a class right so again. Alexa Deprisco: there's the type are still have a plasma, though.\nNo. Andrew Ippolito: there's no plasma it's just it's just has its DNA it's normal chromosomes I mean it might have positives for other things like they're there, I mean the plasmids are all over there's all sorts of different kinds of positions so we didn't have the plasma that produce the capital.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so what what i'll tell you guys is there's a gene on that plasma that includes for protein that makes the caption for Griffith had no knowledge."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 15 (Part 1) - DNA Structure and Function","link":"https://youtu.be/xe4Fl5pmLeY?si=lkqKExgfRfVsLEQ0","chunkTitle":"Conclusion and Reflections on Scientific Revolutions","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito concludes the lecture by reflecting on the nature of scientific revolutions and the importance of challenging existing beliefs.

Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so here's what he did. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, then so this, this is actually what he published this is i'm going to give you a little bit of the history here, so he says the following is an example of many similar experiments which I have made.\nAndrew Ippolito: to discover whether an a violent are pneumococcus can be transformed into the virulent s form by growth in the body of the mouse.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the crazy thing okay everybody who worked in the field at this point in time, hearing this idea of transforming and are into an s would be like us today hearing somebody saying i've managed to turn a cat into a dog.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's insane that that's impossible you can't do that a little bit really that'd be good, though.\nAndrew Ippolito: Turn cast into dog wow there you go.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the idea here is Fred Griffith a world renowned microbiologist who doesn't say crazy things is saying a crazy thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that was the beginning Okay, so this is how scientific revolutions happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's actually a book from the 1960s, about the history of scientific revolutions people like to think that science just moves slow and steady like the hair i'm sorry, like the tortoise and the hare and the tortoise very slow and steady wins the race.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every day work when you're in the lab that's true little bits little bits little bits you publish something here you publish something there and then you build a mountain of data and eventually you show something, but in reality.\nAndrew Ippolito: The way science works is, we have a lot of these false starts start stop start start started, but then every once in a while.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is the beginning of it, somebody publishes something that doesn't make any sense, given the current understanding of things, so in this case it's.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 15 (Part 1) - DNA Structure and Function","link":"https://youtu.be/xe4Fl5pmLeY?si=lkqKExgfRfVsLEQ0","chunkTitle":"Griffith Transformation","chunkSummary":"Griffith's experiment on transformation and the discovery of the transforming substance.","start":"31:10","end":"32:38","content":"Andrew Ippolito: On the other hand, people who are more conservative might just call that a cell free experiment.\nAndrew Ippolito: So i'm sorry i'm sorry um. yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what the free yeah so that I think they just avoided in vitro and Bebo and our left but.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call themselves free experiments versus in sales we just avoided in between in between in vivo.\nAndrew Ippolito: Its context dependent if you're reading a paper about a mouse that's me both reading the context of the cell is in vivo well so it's just you know you have to take the whole context of the experiment it anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: So.

Andrew Ippolito: while ago, I mean his his heyday was in the late 40s.\nAndrew Ippolito: He was an old man when Watson and Crick republishing their work in the 60s. Andrew Ippolito: Actually, so there, he is there's there's every passing the torch kind of I have no idea what this is it looks like some kind of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually, what this probably is what you're looking at here is a picture from some kind of international scientific Convention.\nAndrew Ippolito: And avery was being you know he's you see how he's at that table, he was probably being honored for some of the science work and that's Watson and Crick shaking his hands.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the ones that discover the double helix so it's just neat to see the three of these guys together in this picture I forgot, where I found this i'm sure their story I don't know the details of this stuff here.\nAndrew Ippolito: In any case, here's how avery's group did their work okay so ready here i'll walk you through this um.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's Okay, so we have in this test tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have the S that's been heat inactivated plus the living are right, so if we then take this directly.\nAndrew Ippolito: And do it, you know, in the fancy multi step process that they established, we will show that we can have.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can recover an s bacteria right so there's the transformation that's the control, we can transform it we take heat in activated us we add it with living are we get living us we've transformed the aren't and you can see it, even though you can do like this art.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now what we're going to do. Andrew Ippolito: This here i'll say well let's let's build a little bit more of a granular pathway here so here's.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's a. Andrew Ippolito: heat activated us.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: And here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is our just fresh are. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we're going to take as as the control we're going to take the heat and activated s and the living are we're going to recover s okay so here that's why just rewrote exactly what I just said over here just in a more detailed way, so I can show you what they did.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that would be like control, you know, the first control that we're just repeating what we can.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now what we're going to do is before we mix these i'm going to take heat and activated ass and i'm going to pre treat it with an enzyme called a protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: What protease does is it basically shreds proteins and breaks them down to their amino acids and the idea here is.\nAndrew Ippolito: If the transforming substance is made out of protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we destroy the proteins, we would expect not to see transformation happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here, so we mix he inactivated so that has been treated with protein with living are.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we recover s. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so here that's us that's us right so so that shows us.\nAndrew Ippolito: That protein is not essential for transformation.\nAndrew Ippolito: proteins are not essential for the transformation, you can add alexa. Alexa Deprisco: Really quick, could you describe the protease enzymes as like a D metering and zone.\nAndrew Ippolito: No it's more like a paper shredder. Andrew Ippolito: Okay it's like we're ripping if If you recall, you know polly peptide chains are strings strings of amino acids held together by peptide bonds right protein cases break the peptide bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's a whole world here proteins is that i'm not getting into there's XO protease is an endo proteins is there's protein aces which are specialized in ripping apart three dimensional proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: As opposed to a. Andrew Ippolito: pep to this, which is specific to peptides so it's a whole world, but so we're just going to oversimplify this and say they treated this with enzymes that shredded proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, because the key here is that proteins are not important to transformation, they are disposable there dispensable.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now let's recall what what are sales made out of right they're made out of lipids they're made out of carbohydrates."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 15 (Part 1) - DNA Structure and Function","link":"https://youtu.be/xe4Fl5pmLeY?si=lkqKExgfRfVsLEQ0","chunkTitle":"Hershey and Chase Experiment","chunkSummary":"The final proof that DNA is the genetic material using radioactive isotopes.","start":"55:58","end":"1:02:49","content":"Andrew Ippolito: That put the last nail in the coffin the last proof that it was DNA and people after this point people stop doing research on the question.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if they did, that nobody's publishing anything anymore so i'm gonna explain now hershey and chase Okay, so this is experiment number three we had Griffith transformation, we have avery oh look it's probably DNA and then hershey and chase it's totally DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here's how they did their experiment they took advantage of a very simple chemical difference between proteins and DNA proteins have a whole lot of sulfur in them and not not a lot of phosphorus and DNA has a whole lot of phosphorus but not a lot of sulfur.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we have to radioactive isotopes of phosphorus and software, we got P 32 women got s 35 Both of these are radioactive.\nAndrew Ippolito: They take a virus called the bacteria feeds bacteria or viruses that only infect bacteria that can affect ourselves so that's good.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, like most viruses, like all viruses, the bacteriophage they used to call it to the bacteria feeds T to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Had I mean it had a relatively simple structure, compared to a cell but, honestly, this thing it looks like a moon lander.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, it looks like something would land on the moon, actually, if you look at the electron microscope slides of I mean this really it looks like something that would land on this trip so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's here's how they work, the they have a DNA genome and they have this fancy body around them made out of proteins so black would be protein blue would be DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And and i'll tell you this now they didn't know how this works, but the secret is is one these little filaments buying to the cell surface of the bacterium they actually this whole body in the middle here compresses like a syringe.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it basically injects the DNA into the cell it's ingenious it's pretty cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now they didn't know any of that they just knew that that so what they didn't know was that a virus.\nAndrew Ippolito: transforms cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so viruses have to have.\nAndrew Ippolito: Both nucleic acid and protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they transform cells, meaning they are changing the genome type meaning they are delivering the genetic material.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they knew that much right viruses have genetic interior, the question is is which one of these is the genetic material for the buyers is that the protein that nucleic acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it's a very ingenious setup. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's what they do, they do to experiments in parallel, one on the experiments uses review after phosphorus one of the experiments uses radioactive self okay so imagine you take a petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: filled with bacteria ECO lie. Andrew Ippolito: I think that's what they used Okay, they infected with the T to feige.\nAndrew Ippolito: The media in here is supplemented with P 32 okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which means that as those T to bacteria features and eco lie, as they make their new DNA their DNA will then to incorporate the radioactive phosphorus so they will have radioactive.\nAndrew Ippolito: DNA. Andrew Ippolito: Okay separately.\nAndrew Ippolito: We do the exact same thing we culture some tea, too, but, in the presence of the supplement containing s 35.\nAndrew Ippolito: So in this case we have radioactive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Protein. Andrew Ippolito: So i'm going to replace radio after i'm gonna say hot we'd say that the DNA is hot weather proteins hot that's what we talked about this woman do radioactive work in the lab cold and hot.\nAndrew Ippolito: temperature it's radioactivity. Andrew Ippolito: So we'd say the hot DNA the hot protein nickel Dini and corporate that's how i'm gonna talk from here on out so we're gonna take.\nAndrew Ippolito: The feige with the hot DNA we're going to inspect some cells, but just for a little while Okay, so the life cycle of the teacher is very fast.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so within the early within early infection the fields will have brought its.\nAndrew Ippolito: genetic material into the cell Okay, so I want you to picture here's this cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: The alien bobblehead moon lander lands on it. Andrew Ippolito: And then inject something into the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, at that moment in time, so they wait, maybe 20 minutes They infect the cells in a liquid test tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then. Andrew Ippolito: They take that liquid and they put it in a blender.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like a common household blender. Andrew Ippolito: And the idea is is that when it's in the blender it's going to knock the virus off the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's going to take the whole body of the virus and just bought but away so we separate the two so, in other words, the idea is the virus lands on us so and jack's its thing does its business, and then we knock it off, and then we centrifuges.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and when we centrifuges. Andrew Ippolito: When you centrifuge anything like this there's a solid and there's a liquid the solid we call the pellet.\nAndrew Ippolito: The liquid we called anybody know the name of this you guys run this on the classes, yet what do we call the liquid fraction of a centrifuge sample.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay ready you're going to learn that from me then it's called the super super.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then end at.

Andrew Ippolito: Now I don't think a whole lot super I always miss spell this word or maybe I don't super.\nAndrew Ippolito: supernatural super super in a tent yeah right okay super name some people pronounce it separate and I think it's super Nice and we call it the soup it's just soup.\nAndrew Ippolito: which makes sense because soup is liquid so there's the soup and the palette palette on this."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 15 (Part 1) - DNA Structure and Function","link":"https://youtu.be/xe4Fl5pmLeY?si=lkqKExgfRfVsLEQ0","chunkTitle":"Introduction","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the topic of DNA structure and function.","start":"0:00","end":"0:45","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This is our DNA structure and function lecture this is chapter 16.

Andrew Ippolito: A woman showing her lab work would be criticized more heavily and they would be more skeptical about it than a man's so there was a whole lot of sexism in the 1950s in Britain in in science and it's still there.\nAndrew Ippolito: to a lesser extent, obviously, but but it's very.

Andrew Ippolito: there's a bond here she was missing, but she was almost spot on with a lot of this and as the story goes if she had another two weeks or so of time to work on this she might have independently developed the double double stranded helix but she did.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's another interesting part of the story you've heard this guy's name before Linus Pauling.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's the one that helped with hemoglobin and sickle cell disease he's also the one that came up with the Alpha helix so he was heavy duty into 3D protein structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: Linus Pauling was the first excuse me, the first famous American scientist in this in this field, so he was an American and, of course, the Brits and the Americans have always had their fun little.\nAndrew Ippolito: rivalry so when when Britain learned that Linus Pauling was working on the crystal structure of DNA that's when they very tried to quickly scramble and scoop the Americans.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so they got Watson and Crick on board here so Watson and Crick are old British dude young American post, so they were kind of an article."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 15 (Part 1) - DNA Structure and Function","link":"https://youtu.be/xe4Fl5pmLeY?si=lkqKExgfRfVsLEQ0","chunkTitle":"DNA Double Helix","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the structure of the DNA double helix, including the sugar-phosphate backbone, base pairing, and anti-parallel strands.","start":"1:54:37","end":"1:56:16","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So it's a double strand helix it's got the sugar face phosphate backbone on the outside it's thickness it's thicknesses two nanometers.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that spacing between them basis is point three four nanometers such that exactly one twist gives us exactly 10 base pairs, which is very satisfying number, because we have 10 fingers no relation.\nAndrew Ippolito: The strands are anti parallel You might remember that so revisit what you learned in the past and now go into the details here we have a five to three or three to five anti parallel right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when they see the horizontal pairing is restricted they're talking about this right if there's a T on one strand there's got to be an A, on the other, there's a G on one strand there's gotta be a G, on the other, but vertically.\nAndrew Ippolito: Any order.

Andrew Ippolito: Now, at the higher level of this right, so I mean.\nAndrew Ippolito: To to list again here, there is a complex of enzymes, that is insanely large and multi part burger going to bind to each of these forks so the circle i'm drawing here, because a complex we're going to call this the DNA polymerase.\nAndrew Ippolito: hollow enzyme H O l O big hollow enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: A hollow enzymes and enzymes enzyme with multiple parts. Andrew Ippolito: So the healer case that oh boy saw marines the polymerase the primates all that's the single strand the binding proteins is all and.\nAndrew Ippolito: And each fork is associated with a hollow enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: And for our purposes, you can imagine that the hall enzyme is going to move along that fork it is going to move away from the replication for it.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's going to go this way, the whole thing is going to go this way. Andrew Ippolito: Right, and so this one's going to go that way, this is called bi directional bi directional replication.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can in theory have uni directional replication.\nAndrew Ippolito: stay with me. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: questions.\nVictoria Bloemker: middle one is the bubble one right. Andrew Ippolito: Well, the bottom has a bubble to.\nAndrew Ippolito: say here, let me, let me draw need oh here just look here so there's the bubble, so the hololens on will bind either here or here and I will go this way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so do you see how each. Andrew Ippolito: hollow enzyme is going to have. Andrew Ippolito: To make two brand new strains of DNA.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: And those are the merging of the sister chromatin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those would be the sisters right genetically identical.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so in prokaryotes where we got that circular ring of DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's that single origin, and so, from that point the bubble occurs and you get this bi directional replication.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you get to daughter molecules. Andrew Ippolito: And eukaryotes we have multiple origins of replication so that, over time, those hololens always bump into each other, you can think of them as the bubbles eventually merging together and eventually that's going to result in to daughter molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is your justice, just as humans, and you can see here.

Andrew Ippolito: All right, I should say what I just explained to you is the reason why we have the private alright so here ready here's the original.\nAndrew Ippolito: Power molecule DNA let's see this is the five prime men, and this is a three primary and so these are the individual nucleotides.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So we want to build a compliment to that that's what let me use the whiteboard because I can use different colors So here we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's the original DNA here's the five prime here's the three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so here are the individual nucleotides. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so I could rip this apart, you know you can imagine, right here, if I pulled this out like this, this would be the five prime this would be the three primary maybe that's an A.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's an individual nucleotide alright, so the new one right, in theory, we want to build this right, this is our goal we want this molecule three prime to five, and we want these to be complimentary.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's our end game right there so so this thing here i'm going to delete this now, how do we build it well let's pretend let's just start at any random nucleotide let's just start right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this is what it would look like in theory right, that would be the first nucleotide Okay, if this wasn't a this would be a ti.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so here, this would be the three prime how do I know that because i'm looking here, I see this is a five, this has to be a three.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this has to be the five which way, am I, adding the next one left to right, am I, putting it here or here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good going to go this way, so the next nucleotide is gonna be right here. Andrew Ippolito: So here's the problem of DNA polymerase DNA polymerase can do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: All DNA components can do is if I already have an existing strand of nucleotides and I have a three prime available and to add to I can now add nucleotides this way so that's the role of DNA polymerase we called DNA p.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so DNA deployments can't start the job, but it can finish the job, and so we need to prime it, and so what we do is, we have an enzyme that can start a nucleotide chain from scratch it's called RNA primates.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what arnie primates does. Andrew Ippolito: Is after he'll a case.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has unbounded. Andrew Ippolito: here's the concept of my slide so here's here's the five prime three prime okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: The key is is that primates sets down a few nucleotides it's a starter set.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's made out of RNA, though. Andrew Ippolito: So this is a weird DNA arnie hybrid molecule, which is a problem, but we're not going to deal with that problem just yet, because we have another problem DNA polymerase doesn't know where to start a job because he's an idiot he can't start this from scratch.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we get primates to do it. Andrew Ippolito: And there's where DNA permission to start his job so we prime so we unwind it with your keys we release the tension with two boys summaries we've protected with single strand binding proteins, we now prime the track.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and again you're going to make this mistake if you're not careful you're going to want to grow this way because that's the three primary.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it's anti parallel we're going this way because the new strands three prime and is the important strands three prime and that's the important three.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So DNA polymerase thing comes along here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And as you see the DNA with the Roman numeral three, so this is DNA polymerase DNA polymerase three it turns out, there are multiple DNA polymerase is you don't have to know all of them, but know that three is the important one here that's going to extend the strand.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so watch this and then lay some tracks okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, the blue the blue tells us that's the oxy ribosome that's DNA the red tells us that's our.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we now have like from here on out that's good DNA that's what we want right oops this is this is RNA we're gonna have to eventually get rid of that lead.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so DNA polymerase three that's the magic of all of it that's the one that says hey that's a T down here, I need to add on a nucleotide.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a a nucleotide that has to be a team nucleotide, this is the see, I have to so DNA polymerase three is the one that gives us the specificity within the base pair.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the secret sauce to all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, a perfect world DNA wouldn't be anti parallel and both strands would be easily synthesized and that would be that, but of course we don't live in a world that things are any nothing's easy."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 15 (Part 2) - DNA Structure and Function","link":"https://youtu.be/kgu3F_Nk3MY?si=Z0RP4Jh_Z7EmacCY","chunkTitle":"DNA Replication and Repair","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of DNA replication and the mechanisms of DNA repair.

Andrew Ippolito: One of the landmark.\nAndrew Ippolito: Studies though tap into the 1940s.

Andrew Ippolito: there's Linus Pauling again remember he's the one that was racing with Watson and Crick and he's doing at the same time, I mean this is this is around the time when he was working on his double stranded he'll a triple stranded helix model, he was also working with a tomato.\nAndrew Ippolito: and studying hemoglobin. Andrew Ippolito: He was trying to understand the molecular basis of sickle cell disease.\nAndrew Ippolito: And one of the things that they realized was that an enzyme this idea of an enzyme isn't one thing all the time, the idea that enzymes can actually have subunits in the case of hemoglobin hemoglobin has two alphas into beta Globe ins.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what they discovered and realized was that each one of these came from a separate gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: So Pauling and autonomy basically refined.\nAndrew Ippolito: The one gene one enzyme hypothesis into one gene one poly peptide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so, if you remember your protein structure stuff remember that our protein can have some kind of tertiary structure right remember the tertiary structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: But then, sometimes proteins can bind together to form higher order structures, a question or a structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's what they realized. Andrew Ippolito: In that genes don't code for the whole enzyme genes just code for a poly peptide basically a chain of amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and again I want to remind you, this is before we understood the DNA helix right, this is pre Watson and Crick pre discovery.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we're still working on it. Andrew Ippolito: And, incidentally 1957 ingram showed why hemoglobin was mutated but the structural basis of it which i'll show you at some point.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so that's the walkthrough of the history here.

Andrew Ippolito: So this is the quote from from his work genes may control or regulate specific reactions in the system chemical reactions either acting directly as enzymes and then here's the key or determining the specificities of enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: He said this during a period of time, when we still wasn't what we still weren't sure that DNA was the genetic material there, he is talking to you see this acting directly is enzymes, you see that, because they really wanted protein to be the genetic material.\nAndrew Ippolito: They just couldn't let that bone go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this this hypothesis outlived the incorrect genes are made of proteins hypothesis.\nTaylor Campbell: And like this, the main reason for that, because of the variation like you were talking about how DNA only had.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like, though, yes, yes. Taylor Campbell: Okay, so that that whole. Andrew Ippolito: that's why they still they really wanted genes to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: proteins because there's 20 amino acids that can be put together in any combination alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: Okay, so like his whole like big picture thing was just that genes determine the specificity of enzymes right.\nAndrew Ippolito: thing the Code, the information to make them as opposed to being it themselves like there's an indirect thing versus a direct thing exactly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Exactly. Andrew Ippolito: Now what i'm going to do now is i'm gonna walk you through his experiment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want to do this kind of quickly because I want to get to the actual mechanisms of genes, so what they did.\nAndrew Ippolito: Was let me, let me explain this. Andrew Ippolito: in a simple way, so we have.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want to use the same terminology, they use here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's two kinds of media there's complete media.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's minimal media.\nAndrew Ippolito: First of all, the reason they using bread mold let's just be clear on this bread mold is hapless.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a fungus their their multicellular state is half later number, which means if they have a mutation occur you're going to see that effective it's there.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the power of using a half but organism for genetic research right if it's deployed, and you make a mutation you still it your mutations going to have to have a dominant phenotype.\nAndrew Ippolito: or it's going to be hidden and recessive state and which is not good, whereas halfway cells, what you see, is what you get.\nAndrew Ippolito: Also, by the 1940s, we had finally understood the relationship between radiation radioactivity DNA damage well they didn't always DNA damage, but the idea of bombarding cells with radiation allowed them to get me to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember that Morgan had to figure out he had to find his fruit flies in the wild, so to speak, he had to find his mutations naturally occurring once.\nAndrew Ippolito: beetle and hate them basically irradiated 2000 petri dishes of bread.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, they went into a gentleman's arrangement, but there was a gentleman's bet not a bet but a gentleman's agreement between the two of them, that said.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're about to embark on finding a needle in a haystack and we're gonna do this 2000 times they probably calculate the number, based on their budget and their lab and if we don't find the mutation that we need within 2000 we're going to call it a wash.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in the 2000 they did they found three. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's it gives you an idea of how hard they literally found three needles in the haystack.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so complete media what complete media contains.\nAndrew Ippolito: All the nutrients that are healthy bread mold needs Okay, the idea is.\nAndrew Ippolito: The parts are fully assembled.\nAndrew Ippolito: The molecules are already intact, so the vitamins are already there we don't have to make them their their.\nAndrew Ippolito: Minimum media contains. Andrew Ippolito: Only the basic components.\nAndrew Ippolito: To build. Andrew Ippolito: needed.\nAndrew Ippolito: molecules. Andrew Ippolito: So, in other words the salts the phosphates, the basic sugars, but nothing complicated guy likes it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, you like okay right so complete media now so all bread mold all wild type.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why i'll tell you bread mold could grow just great in either media.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: In other words, bread molds capable when it needs to right so here's the key when it needs to make things.\nAndrew Ippolito: It will manufacture them from the building blocks. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, or you can just hand it all this stuff so this would be like you coming home from work after a long busy day and seeing either a whole bunch of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Fresh groceries that you can use to make a new meal from, and you know it's going to take you like 40 minutes to cook it all or there's a sack there with some fast food in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to go for the fast food if we're hungry, because we don't want to spend 40 minutes, making our food right and so all organisms, if you give them the prefabricated stuff they're going to use that first that's just a truism in life it's more efficient.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys still with me this making sense. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna take imagine there's a machine here.\nAndrew Ippolito: That looks kind of like those fast food pizza manufacture, you know those ovens where they'll have the conveyor belt they'll slowly put the pieces into them and then warm them up and they come out the other side they're done okay so imagine something like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to put a bunch of petri dishes here, and this is going to radiate them and they're going to come out the other side.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so they're all they've all been fried they've all been irradiated.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So here's the way we're going to do the experiment here's a peach let's say we had a petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and let's say that we had previously inoculated it with.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's let's do let me do this 12345 let's see I put six colonies there it's all the same thing all wild type bread mold Okay, and I fed this through the the radiator and i'm growing this on complete media.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So here let's go to the slide you can see here step one place cells on complete media step to subject them to X rays.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, and now what we're gonna do. Andrew Ippolito: Is we're going to so there's a couple things you can do at this point.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is called replica plating what we're gonna do is we're going to take another petri dish a fresh petri dish that contains minimal media.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Let me.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah so before this so this, this is the step that is skipped in that slide so what you can do is it's kind of neat you take a piece of filter paper that's cut perfectly the size of the petri dish okay you gently place that you press it into the culture okay so imagine a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Imagine a piece of paper that's like this right we press it on there, and while it's on there we we write whoops.\nAndrew Ippolito: We write 123456 we right numbers on in pencil or whatever, and then we take that piece of paper out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and let's see if I can grab this here, we take that piece of paper out no, I think the whole thing Oh well here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's just pretend that I took the paper out here, it is, and I press it down onto this petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, finally, my fingers Mike like gloved sterile fingers right, and then I toss the piece of paper.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then I incubate that. Andrew Ippolito: You know 37 degrees overnight, for you know 24 hours.\nAndrew Ippolito: and the next day I come in. Andrew Ippolito: And I look. Andrew Ippolito: And I see i'm just making this up right now, I see this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and let's say I also because I was smart I marked my petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what's more I even drew little circles. Andrew Ippolito: Around where I will expect those things to grow, so that I know exactly what's there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I know. Andrew Ippolito: they're see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so I say that that 12345 6am I in my lab notebook I would say that in minimal media mmm in minimum media one grew to didn't three didn't for did five did 16.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: So somebody interpret that for me think like a scientist what happened.\nJulia Lakchin: What happened and it went over. Andrew Ippolito: Go ahead Julia. Julia Lakchin: happened it went over.\nAndrew Ippolito: To talk about tequila your your MIC your little soft you enter your lina far away. Julia Lakchin: Half of it went over.\nAndrew Ippolito: Half of it went over. Julia Lakchin: What do you mean like like half. Andrew Ippolito: Oh no, no, no, no let's they all went over so so it's like you look under the microscope you'd see cells there.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's there's material that you're you're really thinking like a scientist you like, you must the experiment.\nAndrew Ippolito: You didn't roll out the piece of paper analysis okay so let's say that you think that you repeat the experiment you take another replica plating and you're like extra super careful this time and you get the same pattern of growth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now what happened. Andrew Ippolito: So, remember, we took this petri dish we irradiated it it came out the other side, and now we see that some of the colonies grew and some of them didn't.\nTaylor Campbell: So, like the thing that went through was it heated. Andrew Ippolito: No it's just X rays.\nAndrew Ippolito: We randomly. Andrew Ippolito: hit all these cells with X rays.\nJulia Lakchin: Of the cells to handle the extra radiation or the other ones put in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay okay so but they're all the same cells right.\nAndrew Ippolito: That no no you're onto it you're on to it, like some of the self seemed to be okay, with it, and some didn't so what's, what do you think the differences between what's the difference between the ones that grew in the ones that didn't.\nAlexis Micewski: mutation. Andrew Ippolito: Exactly. Andrew Ippolito: Okay it's just luck, of the draw.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like this is a game of Russian roulette. Andrew Ippolito: Some some of the cells that didn't grow right, so we can trace them back, we got this original player right so somebody think of an experiment here, what can I do.\nAndrew Ippolito: To further investigate the to the three in the sticks here the ones that didn't grow.\nAndrew Ippolito: What can I do what's the what's what what's an experiment, I could.\nTaylor Campbell: You could have a. Taylor Campbell: Control.\nTaylor Campbell: Okay. Taylor Campbell: So when out without putting it through an x Ray. Andrew Ippolito: So we already did that right so here's the dish that went through the X Ray machine, I have my colonies on there they're still there, you still have them to play with in the lab.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what we've just done is we've taken them and they remember they grew and complete Media we transfer them to minimum media and they fail to grow.\nAndrew Ippolito: So while another thing we go ahead. Taylor Campbell: All of them failed to grow. Andrew Ippolito: know just just the three.\nRight so. Andrew Ippolito: So when we first replica play to them, remember, we put them in the incubator we let them go for 3737 degrees or 24 hours and so colony one colony four and Connie five all grew up.\nAndrew Ippolito: In minimal media. Andrew Ippolito: But two, three and six fail to grow.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here, these didn't grow. Taylor Campbell: Now, what about the X rayed ones.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so that, so we took this whole plate this first plate right here, right. Andrew Ippolito: We took that the whole plate went through.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every single cell on that please go ahead with that trees. Andrew Ippolito: So every single cell is alexa said every single cell does some kind of they got hit with radiation they got randomly mutated.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, on the other side of it so they're still there they're still in the petri dish we're then going to take some we're going to inoculate another plate with those same colonies, but that plate contains minimum media.\nAndrew Ippolito: and three of those six failed to grow in minimal media so what's the next what's the next experiment, we could do.\nAlexis Micewski: To further and resume you could try tuning it incomplete media. Andrew Ippolito: Excellent that's exactly right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so watch this if I then took these irradiated plate, and I transferred this if I did, another replica plate incomplete media."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 1) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=yUrfUruzByHAC2vc","chunkTitle":"Results of Minimal Media","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the results of the minimal media experiment and the growth of different colonies.","start":"33:39","end":"33:54","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so again let's let's make sure we carefully do this 123456 alright, so now so let's look so here's the results of minimal media one grew so we would expect one to grow.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would expect expect five to grow and expect for to grow, of course, and those do grow, of course, but now for the three that didn't grow let's say that this grew and Miss grew."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 1) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=yUrfUruzByHAC2vc","chunkTitle":"Interpreting Experimental Outcome","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito analyzes the growth and non-growth of different colonies and draws conclusions from the results.","start":"33:54","end":"34:16","content":"Andrew Ippolito: We would expect expect five to grow and expect for to grow, of course, and those do grow, of course, but now for the three that didn't grow let's say that this grew and Miss grew.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and this one fail to grow.

Just come out the chains.\nglobe in. Andrew Ippolito: It is globe and okay. Andrew Ippolito: So you got to change to poly peptide fold up in the 3D and you got this you know here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This guy so here, this is pretty much this is a relatively accurate right model of alpha globe and.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the idea is there is a.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is a slot in both of them and, within that slot sits a team group which is basically a carbon scaffold and that him group has, in the core of it and iron Ion.\nAndrew Ippolito: effie and oxygen molecular officer binds to it right and so that's basically think of it like a little little docking port for a spaceship that goes in there that's oxygen in and out in and out The thing is, though, is every time oxygen goes in there Okay, if you look at the slide now.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll see oxygen right here coming in and out okay when oxygen comes in there, you can see, it just nestled in there with the iron.\nAndrew Ippolito: notice that the amino acids in the area around it, are being pulled towards that a little bit, so the whole molecule ends up changing shape just a little bit you see that right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you look very closely, right here. Andrew Ippolito: You see, that little thing sticking out when only only in I should say it's the purple one right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: When oxygen is not bound hemoglobin So you see oxy oxy oxy oxy oxy guys pay attention to D oxy and look at the little purple nub sticking out Okay, so, in the absence of oxygen hemoglobin has this amino acid jut out into space.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in sickle cell disease, the mutation over here changes what is a hydrophobic side chain, so that would normally be good hammock gas it or glutamate.\nAndrew Ippolito: To a hydrophobic one see all those carpets are just that's that's totally nonpolar like oil and water, so the idea is is that when hemoglobin doesn't have oxygen bound to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: This becomes a hydrophobic area, and so what that does is it causes protein aggregation by by trying to hide the hydrophobic residue from the water, and so you can see here in the middle.\nAndrew Ippolito: What happens right, you can see that the hemoglobin.\nAndrew Ippolito: forms these basically these double filaments. Andrew Ippolito: to mask that feeling and so you get these filaments it's not supposed to be a filament it's supposed to be a globular soluble protein and, instead, you have these little hairs basically that causes the red blood cells to start twisting and contorting into that circle shape.\nAndrew Ippolito: which renders it i'm more likely to clog the arteries at our capillary beds and it will also reduce vastly reduced its lifespan.\nAndrew Ippolito: And all of that, from a single base change from an A to you and as well learn at the end of all this that's called so that kind of mutation where you change one residue to another one nucleotide to another it's called a point mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and there's different kinds of point mutations and that right there is called a missiles mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like misspeaking is you're saying the wrong word you meant to say big but you said small instead. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and that's a radical Mrs mutation because we're changing its biochemistry as opposed to a conservative Mrs mutation where.\nAndrew Ippolito: The chemistry is still there it's just a slightly different amino acid, so, in other words, it would be like changing glutamate to aspartame, which is another acidic amino acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well we'll cover that more detail later.

Andrew Ippolito: Right and the reason that we will you get that is there's four possibilities for possibilities for possibilities remember genetics, we had the rule of multiplication right just pick you can just pick of the randomness there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we have 64 can.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember that. Andrew Ippolito: Of the amino acids there's 20th.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this language has to be rich enough to be able to describe all 20 of those amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: As well as tell us hey start making it and then okay stop making it so we need start signals stop signals and then amino acid signals so within that 64 code on all that's there there's only two codes, I want you to memorize The first is the start code on that's a huge.\nAndrew Ippolito: That means start translation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now i'm going to intentionally write the word translation there here's why some people will make a mistake and thing that that starting transcription know.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, we start transcription there but that's not what that is i'll explain how transcription starts later, and then we have what I call the caveman code on.\nYouTube. Andrew Ippolito: That means stop now, to be fair, there are two other stock code ons but I don't expect you to memorize all four of these just to go good analog okay Now you can speak a little DNA and you can also speak a little cave.\nGood. stuff. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All the others, except the other two are not going to worry about all the others code for some of the 20 amino acids now some amino acids, I would say.\nAndrew Ippolito: Most amino maybe even all amino acids. Andrew Ippolito: have multiple codes Okay, so they might have three or four codes, meaning the same thing, like see Lucy.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, when we have the situation where you have multiple code ons meaning one amino acid, the first two letters these first two letters are always the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then third one, is a play you could want to four years later, so this is called the wobble effect.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the purposes of the wobble effect is to guard against changes in the peptide chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: that result from mutations okay so think about it, if you have a random sequence of three letters and you change the last one.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you're introducing mutation to that. Andrew Ippolito: It doesn't change the poly peptide it doesn't change the amino acid rain So these are called silent mutations.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's another one of those point mutations. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so so far you've learned two kinds the silent mutation and the misinterpretation silent mutations of the heartbeat of evolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can actually estimate the divergence of genetics sequences based on the accumulation of silent mutations within the same gene."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Rules and Efficiency of the Genetic Code","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the rules and efficiency of the genetic code, including the wobble effect, silent mutations, and the selection of codon usage.","start":"14:29","end":"22:16","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So, for example, you compare our side of chrome see gene with a dogs and a monkeys and a starfish and a sea urchin and a reptile and a fish and a bacterium.\nAndrew Ippolito: You put them all in a row, and just count the number of changes you pick falls into the exact same row as if you were looking at a geological time record of fossils.\nAndrew Ippolito: down to within the precision of percent error of whatever your technique is and other words that all lines up.\nAndrew Ippolito: For their confirmation of evolution. Andrew Ippolito: Because that's a wobble effect.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now the So this is the way it works here here's the concept we're gonna take that piece of RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that RNA is going to have some kind of code on it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: The link or between it all is the transfer RNA the tiara you can cartoon the T RNA.\nlike this. Andrew Ippolito: is just the cartoony version of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the key here is the tr, so this is a i'll say, well, I mean color code this so here.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is a. Andrew Ippolito: there's two aspects to the transfer are.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first is. Andrew Ippolito: what's called the anti code on.\nAndrew Ippolito: The anti code on is empty sense or complimentary to the code on in the Mr Nick and so these form hydrogen bonds it sticky.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's called sequence specific body that sequence specific recognition okay there's a handshake there and then over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Music use a different color here over here. Andrew Ippolito: Is the amino acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, which amino acid, well, it depends, it depends on whatever this is and and right there that's where the translation occurs okay in the languages.\nAndrew Ippolito: So in this case you a see well really that's The anti code on so let's say the code on a huge G if you looked it up in a reference table would tell you that that's the amino acid Messiah me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so know that that so just know that one miss miss sign is the first amino acid in the sequence of every protein ever made ever forever sometimes it's cut off later, but it's always there to start with.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so right here that's my tiny assigning has the single letter abbreviation of em.\nAndrew Ippolito: It has a three letter abbreviation of met. Andrew Ippolito: All amino acids, have a three letter code and a one letter code.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's an easy one. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so do you see that the T RNA is the secret sauce the tiara is what decides what amino acid comes in, with that anti code on.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so how did it get there right How did this amino acid get attached so there's an enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of course there's always an enzyme right so there's a special enzyme called Oh, let me before I tell you what that okay this amino acid here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see us attached to an organic molecule right you guys remember functional groups.\nAndrew Ippolito: Member how functional groups are called functional groups only if they're attached to another molecule right like the hydroxide ions Oh, we just floating around.\nAndrew Ippolito: But if it attaches to an organic molecules now the hydroxyl group rate in the same way and amino acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: attached to another molecule could be construed as a functional group, so this here is called an amino acl functional group, technically, so this is what we're going to call this molecule itself, this is called an amino.\nAndrew Ippolito: acl tra. Andrew Ippolito: Think of it as.\nAndrew Ippolito: A charged apart to RNA. Andrew Ippolito: and other words it's a loaded gun it's got its amino acid it's ready to be used.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the enzyme that does this is literally i'm just going to scroll over here, so I can just add the next word transferees.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're just making that up you just put you can't just put s at the end of a word of making an enzyme no that's actually what they do.\nAndrew Ippolito: The garbage truck is a pickup piece, you can just transfer stuff it's a transfer okay so there's do this is a mouthful now I mean we use elt RNA transferees actually actually technically it's a centerpiece i'm sorry i'm sorry I messed that up synthetic.\nSynthetic piece. Andrew Ippolito: it's making not transferring although it's semantics at that point, really, it could have been named either one it just depends on who names these things, but those are called synthesizes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sometimes you'll see other enzymes that are called synthesis there's no distinction, to my knowledge between some distance of the taste, is just the person's preference who named it.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you discover something you get to name it right so remember ATP synthesis remember the hands on that makes ATP that's a sympathies, this is ameena results yarn a centerpiece maybe these wanted to put as many syllables in there as possible because already a big word, who knows.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so here's here's The second reason why the wobble effect where action, in my opinion, is probably the more important one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think about the fact that sells need to be as energetically efficient as possible okay actually that that's an important principle here I want you to write this down this is going to come up a couple of times today cells strive.\nTo be. Andrew Ippolito: As an are genetically.\nAndrew Ippolito: Efficient. Andrew Ippolito: as possible.\nAndrew Ippolito: If they can cut corners, are going to cut corners. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so here's the insight want to me only silty RNA sent the taste, you can charge all of the different tr nays.\nAndrew Ippolito: That have.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let me, let me come up with a more systemized way here. Andrew Ippolito: i'm thinking of the wobble so we have amino acid or nucleotides one and two and then X whatever X is right doesn't matter so.\nAndrew Ippolito: And those would be different letters let's do this let's do X.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's do this w X, Y.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is there a tcg right so there's there's in theory there's four different yarn age that have the first two letters that are the same than a different last letter right, so a single tyranny centipedes can take care of all those.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we don't need 64 enzymes. Andrew Ippolito: Which are expensive to make now, we just need maybe 20.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense, raise your hand that made sense. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, good.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it's an efficiency thing. Andrew Ippolito: So guards against mutations and and it makes the cell not have to make so many proteins that might need.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this leads to other interesting issues such as the code ons that ourselves us right so think of this think of these as code ons you know, a B, C and D right so each of those let's i'm just making this up let's say that each of these codes for the amino acids Lucy."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Rare Codon Usage","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of rare codon usage and its impact on protein synthesis, highlighting the need for specific bacterial strains in gene expression experiments.","start":"22:24","end":"25:53","content":"Andrew Ippolito: hypothetically in ourselves and let's say all mammals let's say mammals tend to use these three code ons for that amino acid bacteria tend to use this one.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see that.

Andrew Ippolito: From yeah. Andrew Ippolito: It sounds good yeah so so there was this King back in ancient Egypt.\nAndrew Ippolito: That wrote some Royal decrease in three languages because his people he had such a big empire, there were three languages, there was Aramaic there was Greek and there was Egyptian.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the discovery of this tablet allowed us to say oh that's an Ian Greek that's an Aramaic and so must be with hieroglyphic means, which means we can go into the tombs and we can decide for their artwork.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the rosetta stone was a key to understanding translation, so I call the chart actually this chart here that we're going to look at in a second you get to it, I call this the rosetta stone of molecular biology this lets us do all the translation.\nAndrew Ippolito: So anyway, the bacteria that I was using.\nAndrew Ippolito: The normally call a strain, to make the proteins didn't use one of the human color dawn's so I was putting a human gene into bacteria the bacteria had no idea what to do with this code on and so just stop there.\nAndrew Ippolito: It would just be like, I have no idea what to do here, air 54 you know it was like don't compute.\nAndrew Ippolito: The rosetta strain of bacteria is an artificially engineered version of it that has all of the trn a synthesis of humans.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, she gave me some of hers she had some because she had ran into this problem couple years ago. Andrew Ippolito: And I did an experiment side by side with my bacteria and there was edited bacteria and when I ran the gels here was my old one down here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here the control would be this big here's the human version and the human cells here's my bacterial and you call lie and then here's the one from rosetta.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was so satisfying to see that after about two years of maybe not two years might have been like a year, I mean i'm exaggerating it now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the idea here is this code is universal, but it's not always used in the same way Okay, so now that we're here, you can see right here, look for code on free for Lucy."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Reading Frames and Codeon Repeats","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses reading frames and codeon repeats, demonstrating how different start points can result in different codeons and repeats within the genetic code.","start":"26:05","end":"32:08","content":"Andrew Ippolito: You guys see you, you see, you see, you see you.

Andrew Ippolito: All right, so some rules of the language let's go back here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so the the way this was hammered out the way we discovered this there was this group of researchers who used basically.\nAndrew Ippolito: precursor red blood cells from rabbits called ridiculous sites.\nAndrew Ippolito: ridiculous, it is a amateur read bloods. Andrew Ippolito: it's protein factory it's got lots of rough er that's what caught a ridiculous ridiculous endoplasmic reticulum got lots of rough er lots of rob isms lots of amino acid lots of tea rnas all you have to do is life, the cells and then add your own.\nAndrew Ippolito: Artificial RNA. Andrew Ippolito: And it will make your amino acids and so what they did the very first experiment they ever did was just a poly poly a.\nAndrew Ippolito: You just put a whole bunch of ease in there and what popped out of that was a bunch of Fino alanine.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can imagine how exciting that must have been to ask a question, a or to make a statement, a and then get an ECHO back Fino alanine Fino alanine if you allow me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then how about you, you or to CCC or DG right, so they basically artificially translated a bunch of artificial rnas and they got sequences out of it, to the point where they got really good at it, where they could do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's let's look at the sequence for a second, so we can understand this. Andrew Ippolito: is just a repeat of ua ua ua ua ua.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so, but I want you to see this okay so let's that code on as a you are you a you right.\nAndrew Ippolito: But what if I saw that if I started reading it position one. Andrew Ippolito: What if I started reading it instead of position to, then I have the code on a way right to see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what if I start reading it in position three, then I have my view a you again.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so.

Andrew Ippolito: Does that make sense right.\nAndrew Ippolito: The way I see this is there's a swarm of protein in there, this i'm not going to teach you the complexity of this, there are a lot of transcription factors that start this in eukaryotes.\nAndrew Ippolito: They swarm the promoter like a bunch of ants carrying a banana that's the idea of RNA polymerase right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you've we've all seen at one time or another in our lives we go outside, we see a bunch of ants carrying something as a group right that's kind of how I see the protein swarming onto the promoter and then recruiting the RNA public.\nAndrew Ippolito: art. Andrew Ippolito: So transcription factors right, these are proteins that regularly gene expression by binding to the promoter and then they either recruit or block polymer, this is what makes them plus or minus Okay, so there is transcription active eaters.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's transcription repressive. Andrew Ippolito: notice we call them represses and not inhibitors we repress gene expression we don't inhibit gene expression it's just the English of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I want to teach you. Andrew Ippolito: To have them, these are the ones I worked on, which is why i'm teaching them to, because these are the ones I know the best an example of a gene activator is a to F.\nAndrew Ippolito: E to F, is a positive regulator or an activator of jeans and S phase.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so think about that for a second etfs bind to promoters of genes, that we need to be on when we go into SPS go back to the cell cycle, remember, we go from one to s right the way we go from do you want to so by turning genes on that go into s phase and each one of those players.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then our be the retinoblastoma protein PR be is the oppressor.\nAndrew Ippolito: It also happens to be the first tumor suppressor.\nAndrew Ippolito: discovered. Andrew Ippolito: tumor suppressor, as its name suggests, suppresses the growth of transform cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it is a negative growth regulator its job is to bind to promoters, the best fees jeans and stay there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's the concept. Andrew Ippolito: This is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Active repression. Andrew Ippolito: that's a key concept to understand the way regulation works okay active repression, meaning you're keeping your hand so imagine there's a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let me think Okay, you know when you open the refrigerator the light goes on right. Andrew Ippolito: You shut the door and the light goes off you open the door light goes on, think about when you open the refrigerator right from a side view of it if this is your refrigerator side you there's a button in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and when you push down on that button. Andrew Ippolito: right when you when your finger is pushing up button right, so this is on, and this is now off right as long as you keep holding that it's off.\nAndrew Ippolito: You are actively keeping that button off right there's a little spring in here that's how it works right so when you let go of it, it POPs back opening camp okay so that's an example of active repression.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which means. Andrew Ippolito: If this protein suffers a loss of function.\nmutation. Andrew Ippolito: Now the genes that it turns off or accidentally going to be turned on.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what leads to carcinogenesis that's how cancer works. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and I know i'm hitting you with a lot, but you can pause this and rewatch this later whatever so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So be got ETF. Andrew Ippolito: activates SPS genes.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have PR be that inhibits it. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, there are always these tug of wars going on here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so there's things that activate this and there are things that inhibit that and vice versa, and things start to get messy and we're not going to go there.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now the next layer of complexity eukaryotic genes and our cans."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Transcription Factors and Gene Regulation","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the role of transcription factors in gene regulation and how they can activate or repress gene expression.","start":"1:11:24","end":"1:19:30","content":"Andrew Ippolito: All right now the next layer of complexity eukaryotic genes and our cans.\nAndrew Ippolito: within their open reading frame.

Andrew Ippolito: Think of them as.\nAndrew Ippolito: The expressed code.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we want just the excellence, we don't want the entrance in our RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, think of the N tron. Andrew Ippolito: and different books use different phrases I say they are interests first code on there not code on there interspersed sequences.\nAndrew Ippolito: There in between so in tron in between.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I think another way of doing this region that's where the oh when comes from region interspersed region.\nAndrew Ippolito: expressed code ons you could say express region it doesn't matter what they stand for the point is that the axons contain the useful code ons to make the protein in the interim step.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.

Andrew Ippolito: actually make it Nice and short here here's Exxon one.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's in tron one. Andrew Ippolito: And here's Exxon to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so Exxon one. Andrew Ippolito: PICs on to.\nAndrew Ippolito: in Toronto one. Andrew Ippolito: i'm just going to just to illustrate this simply i'm going to show you this so let's say that we we make the piece of RNA Okay, so we do transcription, and so what we're looking at here now we're going to call the primary.\nAndrew Ippolito: transcript. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is the piece of RNA that we've just made from transcription RNA polymerase to me this.\nAndrew Ippolito: over here. Andrew Ippolito: Is it's five prime and over here it's three minutes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So i'm going to skip ahead here and go into RNA processing and just give you the quick steps here, the first thing we're going to do is, we need to protect this end from being enzymatic be degraded, we need to protect the CAP or the end so we're going to cap it.\nAndrew Ippolito: The way we do that is by adding a special.\nAndrew Ippolito: message related guanine. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is methyl think of it as methodology.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know I guess you can say gee subscript m it's a methylation guanine This is called the five prime CAP.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it protects it. Andrew Ippolito: From enzymes called.\nRNA. Andrew Ippolito: XO nucleobases.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of them like PAC man.\nAndrew Ippolito: wants to eat the XO nucleus from the outside, and no nucleus would cut it from within we're not talking about those now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we protect the five prime CAP then over here at the three prime and.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a there's a signal in here that I said to you earlier, is called the poly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Dental elation sequence. Andrew Ippolito: So there's an enzyme that binds to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that enzyme is polly a. Andrew Ippolito: plumber.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the job of a plumber is is to basically add a whole bunch of add an easier.\nAndrew Ippolito: For us to pay a it knows, one word it's not a very good plumber, just as one word hey.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we call this the three prime tail or sometimes we say the three prime polly a tail.\nAndrew Ippolito: We say that the process is polly Dan elation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so now let's go back to these excellent. Andrew Ippolito: So here's how you doodle a a transcript if you have multi colors you can go like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call this the mentor transcript. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, actually, no, no, we don't know we don't don't start stop right because we still have to get rid of the Internet Okay, so the last thing we're going to do so, we kept it we tell it and now we're going to splice it and here's how the spacing works there are sequences recognized here.\nAndrew Ippolito: called boundary elements.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they are recognized by this big special enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, really i'll tell you what let's make it simple let's. Andrew Ippolito: Just the whole this whole thing is bound, this is called the splices.\nAndrew Ippolito: splice within a splice and then oh zone so it's spicy ozone but it's spices.\nAndrew Ippolito: spices them like the ribosome is made out of protein and special rnas we're not going to learn about.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, there are small nuclear little RNA is called SN rnas but we're not learning that in this class Okay, but the idea, there is, those are Naser in there and they recognize these boundary elements we can recognize the interim Exxon boundaries.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when they do this is what the spices um does. Andrew Ippolito: It will bend.\nAndrew Ippolito: That RNA. Andrew Ippolito: Such that it loops out.\nAndrew Ippolito: That interim. Top tail.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that. Andrew Ippolito: So the spices i'm. Andrew Ippolito: not sure the spices on it lifted up and then What it does is a cuts this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it ends up releasing it. Andrew Ippolito: So the interim.\nAndrew Ippolito: is cut out. Andrew Ippolito: And released.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what that does is it results in the two exxon's which are now pasted together alright, so the Spice the muscle leggett's them together.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you now have your miniature transcript.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this gets exported.\nAndrew Ippolito: To the cytoplasm.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so i'm going back to the slides now show you all this.

Andrew Ippolito: You see how the ta ta says minus 30, and this is plus one, so these numbers correspond to the distance from the start code on a huge okay so let's that serves as our anchor point so he would say that the top box lies 30 bases downstream from the start side.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And in fact if I handed you the coronavirus genome and I asked you hey how many open reading frames, do you think this thing as.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can read through it and you can look for ta and you can look for a new G, and if they're 30 away from each other, maybe you could call that an open reading frame that's the way things work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright there's tip top binding protein binding to the ta site right, but then there's this guy here she says tf.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, those are it looks like two eyes as a Roman numeral two for RNA polymerase two, so this is transcription factor for RNA polymerase to, and this is transcription factor too deep.\nAndrew Ippolito: because that was the one that was it was discovered fourth, I guess, so this is tf 2d.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this is how you would tell the story for this gene to turn on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Top Tata binding protein bar so the top box recruiting tf 2d.\nAndrew Ippolito: This complex in turn recruits tf to a anti have to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: which in turn recruit tf to E and T F H, and once you have this called the pre initiation complex that would recruit the RNA polymerase to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, for us, for what I want you guys to understand is, I just want you to understand the concept of the pre initiation complex pre initiation complex, which is made out of transcription factors called tf tues.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to see that as a swarm of insects on a piece of fruit.

Andrew Ippolito: um. Andrew Ippolito: Any questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is kind of like a stupid question, but like it's. Andrew Ippolito: stupid questions at this point, no. Andrew Ippolito: that's stupid.\nAlexa Deprisco: it's honest strand of RNA. Andrew Ippolito: seek Sagan Why can I sleep complex that you just talked.\nAlexa Deprisco: About it's on a strand of RNA right. Andrew Ippolito: Ah. Andrew Ippolito: No that's a great question though so here's your double stranded DNA everything we're talking about is on the DNA OK, so the promoters this region of double stranded DNA right, so the top box is actually.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's it's actually double stranded DNA, and so the ttp binds to the actual DNA so here, so my little.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's up okay so here looking for a second here's double stranded DNA here's my little 3D printed DNA see this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so if you can imagine that, if this was flexible and if I could kind of untwist this and make it look like the screen right so so there's like a ti a ta ta so there's a protein that will literally.\nAndrew Ippolito: bind to those sequences. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and then another protein and turn.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: wow that was fun, so this interaction here is sequence specific right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually, this works really nice, I never did this before her.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's try this one more time so here's a tip.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it binds within the groove of the DNA in a sequence specific manner right and then tf 2d would come along tf 2d doesn't bind the DNA pod binds to pvp.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you can imagine, now the swarm that comes around the DNA that essentially culminates into.\nAndrew Ippolito: Something that would probably look. Andrew Ippolito: more of us.\nAndrew Ippolito: like this. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is the pre initiation complex and now here's.\nAndrew Ippolito: The prima Donna RNA polymerase to that has to be know escorted along here, and so this thing can't bind to DNA directly as no idea just floating around, but it can bind."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Transcription Elongation and Termination","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the elongation phase of transcription and the termination process in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.","start":"1:27:47","end":"1:35:18","content":"Andrew Ippolito: The prima Donna RNA polymerase to that has to be know escorted along here, and so this thing can't bind to DNA directly as no idea just floating around, but it can bind.\nAndrew Ippolito: To all these proteins here like this boom. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that tells it go here use this strand here melt the support and then start moving along the DNA.\nOK. Andrew Ippolito: So the only interactions with the DNA or with the transcription factors now in pro carrier promoter polymerase.\nAndrew Ippolito: much simpler. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so we need a different way of regulating that and we'll teach you that in a SEC.\nAndrew Ippolito: Any other questions. Andrew Ippolito: So we have no RNA yet alexa we have not made a single piece of RNA.\nAlexa Deprisco: So it's the DNA strand that like there's the promoter with like the top top box and then the cpb comes to that and then all of the tf the transcription factors go to that, and then the RNA polymerase goes to that exactly got it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of it like. Andrew Ippolito: At the very end of it all we put the Crown on top.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and I cry that's the RNA polymerase to hold on a second what oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: My predictions coming true what's up Jay I think I open the hot dogs do wrong why I don't know how to do I open open i'm just do your best I got three is an old one Okay, but the others back in a plastic bag i've been trying to get him get him.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: it's okay it's okay i'll be right back.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whatever he's learning that's good okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is the level of detail, I want you to know. Andrew Ippolito: Okay there's a promoter it bonds the transcription factors, the transcription factors recruit the polymerase easy peasy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So that's initiation this this is how you turn in gene on when we talk about Jesus being turned on in cancer or genes being turned off due to pharmaceuticals Okay, this is how it works all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: I said all this to you already there's nothing new here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, I didn't say this it doesn't need a primer, it is a primer right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it doesn't mean it doesn't need to be primed it's not like Dini plum rates right so remember DNA polymerase needs and RNA primer RNA polymerase does it it just goes okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So another question they usually get as well we're all the nucleotides coming from. Andrew Ippolito: there's this idea of the super round metabolic pool Okay, so all of the things that are needed to make anything in the cell are just floating around that's the way to think about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, and so this whole thing that we just learned this is true for all the other types of RNA is the T RNA RNA is the Mr name is the small nuclear rnas the non coding RNA is the snips this nerves whatever okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: elongation is easy, we just ticker tape along, as I say, we ticker tape along the template can we make a piece of art, we just go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now, this can have errors, but we don't talk about errors.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, because here's the key and I want you to think of it this way here's a DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to imagine a whole bunch of plumbers is bound to that DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And each one of those polymer races, is making a piece of RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: So one gene can give rise to thousands or 10s of thousands of transcripts.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would call this a highly express gene. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so yeah mutations can happen in there, but it's just one in a sea of others.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: What I just doodle is right there there it is so this core here is the DNA itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then on this size yeah these are shorter you see how these are all shorter, so what you're seeing here is this.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're seeing many, many, many, many RNA polymerase is doing their job and as they read down this way the RNA gets longer.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And you can also see that as the gene is being transcribed you can already see the splices i'm starting to do his job.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the second that so here, if this is the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the plumber is the second that transcript is coming off it gets kept.\nAndrew Ippolito: that protects it right away, and then the spices on grabs it, and then only after falls off that you get the poly ventilation, the misplacing.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have to know that level of granularity in terms of the stepwise stuff just understand right we have initiation we have elongation we have termination right that's transcription oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's transcription. Andrew Ippolito: Or how much room do I have right here here tx that's transcription initiation elongation termination.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, while elongation is occurring, we got capping.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have splicing we have tail caps place tail right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, lastly, when everything's done we export.\nAll right.

Andrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: The plumbers and twists the double helix about 10 to 20 basis at one time so basically a prize open an entire twist and you get about 40 nucleotides per second and and you carriers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which isn't that fast, the average gene has thousands of base pairs long.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this this isn't like neurons firing Okay, this is more like.\nAndrew Ippolito: From the time you wake up until the time you start feeling like a human well for some of you that's fast.\nAndrew Ippolito: The time you start drinking your coffee. Andrew Ippolito: time you feel it take it into effect.\nAndrew Ippolito: Already okay termination that's just one slide on this and you carry out on a plumber's reaches the end of the coding region and then just Basel the book goes into more detail than you need to know, and it is interesting to read, but i'm not gonna hold you accountable for that information.\nAndrew Ippolito: And prokaryotes there's row so row is a Greek letter, it looks like this there's a road dependent and row independent you know, often on the details there either just understand Rosa protein and there's a terminator region alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: This is like a slide fact that you were saying that the RNA polymerase that. Alexa Deprisco: Like unwinds everything is there, like a top murray's involved there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's a great question.\nAndrew Ippolito: No and here's why, when we open. Andrew Ippolito: Well, so there's a bubble right, you can think of, like a bubble, just like in our DNA polymerase but The thing is, is we close it back up again.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we temporarily unwind it and then it closes again so we actually don't want to go by summaries.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you remember in DNA polymerase we unwind it and we want to stay that way because we're making a new double stranded piece of DNA right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the polymerase is more like a think think of a rug that has a marble underneath it and the marbles rolling under the rug.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so it's moving them rug and then, as it leaves the rug settles again right, so the DNA and twists and then it goes back together again so now there's a healer case activity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but you don't have to know any of that just the RNA polymerase think of marnie plumbers, is the hollow enzyme of the DNA polymerase always with all the moving parts in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have to know any of it okay so there's an enzyme that swoops down pulls the DNA apart and says as told him start reading over here and it says it's easy, you are, it is a tea right, and so it say here, I need an A and then I started building.\nAndrew Ippolito: You still look like you have a headache. Alexa Deprisco: So i'm just trying to like wrap my head around it conceptually so I guess like.\nAlexa Deprisco: I guess like the difference between like this process and, like DNA replication would be like with DNA replication replication you're like pulling.\nAndrew Ippolito: apart, the whole thing to duplicate it. Alexa Deprisco: While like this, like you're just. Andrew Ippolito: Pulling from DNA. Alexa Deprisco: Here here's the picture.\nMaybe this will help. Andrew Ippolito: Right so, so this is DNA right imagine sticking my thumb in here and then just moving my thumb along like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but now it's not entirely accurate, because I can't I can't redo it but.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's just.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe there was a total summaries, but now you're making me think second because I never thought about to apply summaries and transcription.\nAlexa Deprisco: follow up question to what you just did there was, like the wire and everything. Alexa Deprisco: So, like it'll run the whole length of the DNA strand at won't just pull a chunk from it, then.\nAndrew Ippolito: say that again. Alexa Deprisco: So, like you're saying, like the. Alexa Deprisco: bubble it's like moving down like the railroad track of like the double helix so like is it going to go, like the full length of the DNA or is it just going to like pull it chunk out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, it doesn't pull it. Andrew Ippolito: But when you see the full length of God made you mean the whole chromosome.\nAlexa Deprisco: I guess, just like the full end of like a double here. Andrew Ippolito: So. Alexa Deprisco: The big picture view here.\nAndrew Ippolito: would be if so here's so what i'm about to draw the single line is double stranded DNA. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's say that the whole chromosome right remember that chromosomes have those you know the chromatin territories right remember the whole histones and all that so we're going to zoom all the way down into that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so here's plumbers and so we're all going to do is read along here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that bubble is inside of it, the whole time so we're when, as it leaves.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right like think of that is like the the the downstream and the upstream right so as we go downstream we open it and then right behind us it's closed again so we're not permanently making any changes to the double helix we're just we're just peeking in there and coming back out.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense okay that's where the boy summaries I do want to roles of your character, for some reason transcription 2016 oh that's funny this way I learned this stuff a little bit longer than 2016 pillbox commerce's.\nkind of like an immediate bottle. Andrew Ippolito: Here we read the roads are two of our summer sun media and commented dynamics transcription okay yeah this, this is just a review Article.\nAndrew Ippolito: That was published in 2016 so it looks like to book summaries is do player on transcription.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, and that makes it, you know it's funny the second I started moving my thumb along they're like this. Andrew Ippolito: Like I immediately realized like downstream, and that it's going to keep getting tighter so you do need it to a boy sorry, Sir, even though you're not leaving it that way you're still pushing forward and and creating a tension there."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Initiation","chunkSummary":"The small subunit binds to the 5' end of the mRNA.","start":"1:41:25","end":"1:41:38","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So yes, oh boy summaries would make sense there we just i've never thought about it before, because the number it doesn't play any regulatory role, so it was just part of the complex itself.\nOkay. alright.

Andrew Ippolito: You can imagine the longer it is the longer the army is going to hang around.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: here's a schematic on splicing.\nAndrew Ippolito: This stands for small.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know clay or nuclear the nuclear list right inside the nucleus small nuclear solar.\nAndrew Ippolito: rainbow new Clio, in other words.

Andrew Ippolito: RNA plus proteins or rainbow nuclear protein so small nuclear solar rainbow nuclear protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and our NP is the generic fruits RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: arrival nuclear protein. Andrew Ippolito: is a complex of RNA protein, so the rhizome is an example of one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the splices i'm as an example of one. Andrew Ippolito: So these are new things to you you've learned about proteins you've learned about nucleic acids you've learned about lipids you learn about sugars, and now you learned about Robin nuclear pretty.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so it's like it's like a clinical protein, but instead of the sugar being the other part of the team it's the nucleic acid, in particular the RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so you can see here that the spices Ohm is made out of small nuclear the nuclear proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have to worry about loud.

Andrew Ippolito: This dotted line represents the startup translation and this represents the end of it and so everything past this as you tr.\nAndrew Ippolito: And everything past this as you tr.

Alexa Deprisco: go down into the Mr na yes.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was no no. Andrew Ippolito: This this whole thing is Mr Nick. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this, this is the pre Mr RNA and then this is the mature Mr day.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the book says so, this just says Mr RNA, and this is pre Mr so you could also make the argument that it's not technically Mr nay until it's ready to actually get translated.\nAndrew Ippolito: I like the idea of calling it the primary transcript hot off the press and then you got to do stuff to it and then it's mature okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And one more thing, so the.

Andrew Ippolito: hold on a SEC.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the first cells on earth were probably filled with RNA RNA did everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: RNA stored information in a sequence specific manner, so they were genes and RNA catalyzed chemical reactions, so they did the work of the cell and they store the information of the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: As evolution went on DNA eventually emerged, and so the way I like to think of it here's here's my quick story of it rnas entrepreneur.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, when you first start a business, you have to wear all the hats, you have to be the accountant and the marketer and the creator and you have to go out and talk to customers, you have to build this thing right you got to do everything, and nobody can do all those things.\nAndrew Ippolito: At the level of excellence, you need to run a successful company right that's how you start the company once you get going, you start hiring people you hire specialists, you need an account manager money.\nAndrew Ippolito: You need a marketing person to go on and get sales, you need some you know people in the factory to manufacture stuff right while you're in the background you've got your hands and everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right think of the CEO of the box around and kind of visits every department and and knows enough to be dangerous and ask the right questions right that's a successful manager somebody that understands enough of what your job is where they can talk to you intelligently about.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's RNA so RNA can store a little information aren't it can catalyze and chemical reactions, but it delegated the task of storage to DNA and a delegated the work of the cell to the protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it always stayed there in the background and it's got his hands and everything that's why RNA is kind of a molecule can't quite wrap your head around.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because it does it all and it's a mess.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: here's the last concept. Andrew Ippolito: i've introduced the idea before to you have protein domains alright consider a protein let's just consider a hypothetical protein that here here's DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's consider a positive transcription factor like. Andrew Ippolito: so easy to F has a region on the protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is a DNA. Andrew Ippolito: Binding domain.\nOK. Andrew Ippolito: And then so let's say that that DNA bonnie domain has some alpha helix uses a beta sheets of whatever.\nlet's.\nlet's do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's a pair is called a helix loop helix this is beautiful little motif that sticks to the groove of DNA like a pair of scissors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like where's my DNA. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so you got the groove of DNA imagine a pair of scissors that can slide right into the group, like that okay so that's what that is.\nAndrew Ippolito: we'll call that a DNA body to me, and then, as it goes on over here let's say there's another there's a little data sheet and maybe another helix like this, and so we're going to call this the activation domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the activation domain is what say bind to some protein like RNA polymerase.\nAndrew Ippolito: This making sense. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so proteins, you can see, so this protein right here, right if I was to just grab it now let's see if I can.\nAndrew Ippolito: write this protein right here perfect alright, so, in reality, right that's.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's one proteins one continuous poly peptide chain. Andrew Ippolito: But there's two regions of it that do different things functionally so that's what a domain is a domain is this functionally relevant part of a protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Press I want you to be familiar with this concept of a protein. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now here's where things get really awesome when you look at a gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: list so this hypothetical gene that I just made here's Exxon one.\nAnd here's Exxon do. Andrew Ippolito: You see, where i'm going with this now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this Exxon all by itself. Andrew Ippolito: will give us that DNA binding domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: This axon all by itself will give us that trans activation domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words, these are like legal building blocks. Andrew Ippolito: Imagine taking an axon from one gene that binds the DNA and mixing it with a part of another gene that does something different.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so these right here are the Lego building blocks of evolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the way to think. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So imagine for the same protein imagine that I had the splices i'm working on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here i'm just going by what I did it all up there, so there's there's three this is in tron one say let's make the tron yellow right so there's no wrong one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now, when I spice that out normally right, you would get you would get this right.\nAndrew Ippolito: But what if I spliced it where I ignored.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's see if I, so I I spliced it here, but then I ignored.\nAndrew Ippolito: I ignored this spice site.\nAndrew Ippolito: I just ignored it then the loop would look like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what's here just for argument's sake let's see there's another bunch of there's another axon over there, so I can do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here here's one here's Exxon to and here's Exxon, and so here's another.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nSo there's that.\nAndrew Ippolito: There we go Okay, so, in other words. Andrew Ippolito: When I spliced this I ignored Exxon too.\nAndrew Ippolito: So my amateur transcript now is only going to have X on one in three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is called alternative splicing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is how you can go from one gene encoding information to make several.\nAndrew Ippolito: poly peptides. Andrew Ippolito: So the one gene one poly peptide model isn't true either.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here i'll give you a simpler another schematic of this so here's the gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here are the exxon's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's say this gene has seven excellence, so you can imagine a transcript that has just Exxon was just making things simpler just X on one.\nAndrew Ippolito: or axon one and two or one, two and three. Andrew Ippolito: etc, etc, or mix and match them imagine, I had 1246 and seven or 1234 by itself or one and seven by itself okay just just pick you know pick where you're going to splice.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you get you can get a whole family of proteins now from one gene, and so this family of proteins is called a family of ISO forums.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we usually named them with Roman numerals so, for example, there's a protein called P amp L and there are seven nice of forums named P amp l one 2pm seven.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they all have slightly different functions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: raise your hand that made sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay sort of so Alexis asked me a question.\nAlexis Micewski: For each of those proteins they're each different don't mean. Alexis Micewski: yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's different that yeah that's a good way of thinking of it. Andrew Ippolito: There they have different domains so, for example, maybe P amp l one includes the DNA binding domain, but P amp l three doesn't and so P amp l three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because it doesn't ever seen a binding domain, but it has everything else right it's going to still bind to RNA polymerase and now it's a question, so it acts as a negative regulator.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and you can start you're starting to see the cracks and to how insanely complicated things get.\nAndrew Ippolito: them are still not anywhere near the actual level of complexity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but which is why I have to keep telling you guys were the level, I want you to know right, so all understand alternative splicing understand splicing understand protein domains okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you're starting to now become proficient in molecular biology that's what all this is this is molecular biology."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Translation","chunkSummary":"Translation involves the ribosome, mRNA, tRNA, and release factor.","start":"2:05:51","end":"2:27:43","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And you're starting to now become proficient in molecular biology that's what all this is this is molecular biology.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright cool. cool cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is where we're going to stop for our break. Andrew Ippolito: The idea is called axon shuffling this I just learned this later in life, myself and this blew my mind you guys remember crossing over.\nAndrew Ippolito: Number crossing over a mental Ray you can see, you can get your recombinant and all that, so I wanted to now take everything you already learned, but instead of talking about are considering different genes.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to think of a gene with three different excellence three different domains A, B and C.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so on this on this slide here right, you can see, so the blue one represents, you know, whatever you got from mom and aren't would be whatever you got from dad.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's your your genome type capital a capital B capital a lowercase etc, but these instead of these numbers or letters, corresponding to jeans they're different excellence.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so capital he gives us a circle capital B gives us a square capital C gives us a star, and so the protein is going to look like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the lowercase a version gives us the heart the lowercase B gives us a triangle and lowercase C gives us this six sided star son, and so the so these proteins look completely different from each other right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So imagine crossing over occurred here imagine crossing over did this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So now we get capital a capital be lowercase C and we get lowercase a lowercase B capital C we get completely different proteins now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this would be like taking your kids toys and popping the heads off of one and putting it on another and taking the gun from that army guy and giving it to this guy or taking you know, putting this shirt on this doll or whatever we're mixing and matching parts to make new things.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's called axon shuffling and that's, the real reason my interests are so long to is to make sure that crossing over can occur between now.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's another reason I should say. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, let's take a 10 minute break cleanser brains, because I know this is a lot of information and it's getting you're getting hit with it fast, but that's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right really have any control over this. Taylor Campbell: You know how many more chapters, there are that we need to learn.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this. Andrew Ippolito: Is um this is 17. Taylor Campbell: So there's 18.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then just parts of 2020 biotech we're skipping 19 that's viruses Okay, and then this chapter here.\nAndrew Ippolito: 17 and 18 is just jeans right so gene expression and gene regulation and so all of them are it's all interconnected.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if I was to write a book I would probably put those in the same chapter and have two chunks right regular expression and regulation so it's not as much as you think to get to the test right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Taylor Campbell: Yes. Andrew Ippolito: yeah in focus, remember, we got the study guides what those be your beacon to.\nAndrew Ippolito: guide your way in the study all right let's take a 10 minute break and i'll see you guys.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright i'm back.\nVictoria Bloemker: Sam i'm like the next one coming up what chapters is it.\nAndrew Ippolito: broke up touring again. Victoria Bloemker: i'm are the chapters for this exam coming up it's a chapter.\nVictoria Bloemker: Chapter 115 to 18 right. um.\nAndrew Ippolito: No 1616 is DNA. Andrew Ippolito: 1617 1820.\nVictoria Bloemker: Oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So. rest of this stuff we can skip here.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's here's your. Andrew Ippolito: RNA splicing you can see the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Different domains right same idea there. Andrew Ippolito: So the number of genes, we have.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when we talk about all our genes, we talk about our genome right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's our genome and then jeans make proteins right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we have what's called the proteome.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the human proteome is way bigger than the human genome, we don't even know how big it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's estimates that's all we can do.\nAndrew Ippolito: i've already explained, all this new combinations of domains, give us new proteins and possibly new new functionalities right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright translation up, I have a question for you guys when I when I said earlier, you want to do PowerPoint or do you want to do whiteboard and, most of us can do the PowerPoint.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is there something I can do better in the whiteboard to make that better because in the past i've had students want to use the whiteboard mark, so I seen that shift i'm just curious to know what your thoughts are.\nAndrew Ippolito: By one's better than the other. April Neeld: Well, I like PowerPoint because I feel like it's a little more organized and it like when you do a whiteboard you kind of jumbled around but.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah that's what I was thinking. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so. Andrew Ippolito: I that's usually a sign of me being tired when I do that so that's probably what's going on there.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's do let's do this combination we're gonna do translation now so we're gonna go i'm gonna go back and forth and i'll try to stay organized here.\nAlright, so translation.\nAndrew Ippolito: key players right we got the ribosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: The writers, the ribosome consists of the small sub unit.\nAndrew Ippolito: The large subunit. Andrew Ippolito: So you can look at the small subunit kind of looks like a boat large sub you know it looks kind of like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Half hemisphere and really you can think of it collectively as if you've ever watched South park.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know Terrence and fill up the way they draw Canadians disembodied head.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can see that the large Sabine of the rhizome has three grooves in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And those grooves are the site, the site and the a site, you could think of the Environmental Protection Agency EPA the EPA he stands for exit.\nAndrew Ippolito: P stands for. Andrew Ippolito: poly pep title.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a stands for new so it depends on who's talking and what book you're reading, but you can think of a as the amino acl.\nAndrew Ippolito: site, or you could think of it as the acceptor site.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because that's the.\nAndrew Ippolito: key player what key player to is your Mr name.\nYou can call it the mature transcript if you want.\nAndrew Ippolito: key player three we have our let's call my arm, you know is your tiara knees.\nAnd then lastly we're going to have something called the release factor.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So those are key players, the rhizome the RNA the trs and this thing called the release factor that's going to end the game when we're done with it.\nOkay, give me one second guys have to respond to something.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you keep. Andrew Ippolito: Keep writing that down.\nalright.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're back to that again so anyway, there we go okay any questions yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: feel free to interrupt me as i'm explaining this with your questions okay."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Initiation","chunkSummary":"The small subunit binds to the 5' end of the mRNA.","start":"2:27:43","end":"2:29:29","content":"Andrew Ippolito: feel free to interrupt me as i'm explaining this with your questions okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so translation steps.

Andrew Ippolito: And so the nestle so right now that RNA is sitting in the site right that's the site that.\nAndrew Ippolito: The whole. Andrew Ippolito: It didn't move yet i'm sorry guys yeah and you guys are very focused and copying all this down and I just realized.\nAndrew Ippolito: Before we do the moment here. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so before we do the movement here let's let's put this back here Okay, so the sites there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And Okay, so we haven't moved, yet we haven't launched yet so right now that that initial tra is sitting in the piece is still okay nothing's moved.\nAndrew Ippolito: Before the rhizomes another T RNA comes in.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this tra comes along with its amino acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is in the ACI. Okay, so there's the EPA right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you see how the two to your needs are sitting right next to each other ones in the peace site and once in a site OK.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now. Andrew Ippolito: The rhizome is going to move.\nAndrew Ippolito: One coat on. Andrew Ippolito: And while it does, that it is going to transfer.\nAndrew Ippolito: This amino acid on to that amino acid it's going to catalyze the peptide bond.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that we can literally just take this little blue or green dot and put it here like that, you see, I transferred it over there.\nAndrew Ippolito: So at this moment in time, do you notice how the tr Nina sitting in the exit site is now empty.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's like a bullet with a good just it's the empty shell. Andrew Ippolito: Because it's an exit site what happens is this mtt RNA leaves.\nIt exit stage left. Andrew Ippolito: In the meantime notice that this to RNA is now the keeper of the growing poly peptide there's the piece.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this would be like use us wearing a hat let's say you're wearing a hat somebody else comes along with a hat and put the hat on top of you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so now you're wearing two hats and somebody else comes along with a hat and you take your two hats you take them both off and put them on the other person.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you leave and then another person with a hat comes along and the person with the three hats takes all three of their Hats off and puts it on the other person right, so the idea is you're not just adding one, at a time you're literally moving the whole chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so now do you notice that the a site is free.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the next era comes in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we just keep doing this.

There floating around.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the only ones that stick for any length of time, are the ones that have the proper base pair.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have the right anti code on so they can linger because they can stick like velcro.\nAlexa Deprisco: So they're just like kind of exist within this region, but like with the correct piece pairings or not.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah they'll bump like let's say that they call the tyranny is are there right, so the ones that don't have the right anti code on they come in and and bump around but they don't stick.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it happens it thousands of times per second because we're at the molecular level everything's moving super fast, so the only thing that it sticks, there is the one that has the right specificity.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, when they exit this complex did they lose this base parents.\nAndrew Ippolito: Saying alexa. Alexa Deprisco: When they exit this complex, are they going to lose those base pairs of the came in with.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no, no, so. Andrew Ippolito: Those base pairs are integral to their composition let's go to the slide for a second let's look it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's see if there's a cartoony version of your name, are you okay here's try here's the player. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so the sequence of tna looks like this in two dimensions right it forms these to the business two dimensional structure, there are these this base pairing that occurs looks kind of like a three leaf clover.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then what we do is we take that 3D and then we kind of fold it up into really it looks like a gun like a rake gun it's got like you can pick your hand here holding it and it shoots that way, and then over here, where the bullet comes out would be where the amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And down here so anti code ah So you see how the anti code on is is integral to it doesn't lose its anti code on it stops sticking.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think that's maybe what you were talking about here, so this T RNA here leaves.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right this falls off the base pair of the riders on kicks it out okay. Andrew Ippolito: Right other questions.\nVictoria Bloemker: I have a quick one so every time another amino acid is there and it down by a code.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every time the amino acid. Victoria Bloemker: like an amino acid is added it moves down by a code.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah so basically once the T RNA hands it's probably hands it to amino acid to the next one, the ribosome shifts off, so that they can leave and the new one can come in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so we keep doing this again and again and again, and eventually the right, so the ribosome keeps moving this way.\nAndrew Ippolito: The tr nice keep coming in with their amino acids and over time we get this poly peptide that emerges, and then it starts to fall into is alpha helix is in beta sheets and all that, until we come to ogre the STOP quarter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when the rhizome hits the stock code on and the rhizome is sitting with the a site and let's start so that, let me say that differently when the stock code on is in the a site.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so when we have. Andrew Ippolito: This thing is here.\nAndrew Ippolito: When the right business. Andrew Ippolito: Has the a site occupied by ogre by the stuff code on.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is no try instead there is a protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't like red let's use a lighter color you can see better let's use yellow there's a protein that binds here, called the release factor.\nAndrew Ippolito: The release factor binds and it causes dissociation on the entire complex.\nAndrew Ippolito: The basically breaks the ribosome apart and it POPs the poly peptide off.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Post-Translational Modification","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito briefly mentions post-translational modification, which involves additional modifications to the protein after translation.","start":"2:42:40","end":"2:43:13","content":"Andrew Ippolito: That makes sense.\nI hope.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's look at. me now.\nAndrew Ippolito: First, think I have to delete that the first link doesn't work anymore, because it's a flash animation fact doesn't work anymore."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Conclusion","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito concludes the lecture and mentions the upcoming topics of the next chapter.","start":"2:43:13","end":"2:52:03","content":"Andrew Ippolito: First, think I have to delete that the first link doesn't work anymore, because it's a flash animation fact doesn't work anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean they're just how on anymore.

The process is broken into three stages initiation elongation and termination.\nlet's see the process in action. eukaryotic Mr RNA the substrate for translation.\nhas a unique three prime end called the poly tail.\nMr RNA also contains code ons that will encode for specific amino acids.\nA method CAP is found at the five prime end translation initiation begins when the small subunit of the rhizome attaches to the CAP and moves to the translation initiation site.\nTo RNA is another key molecule.\nIt contains an Anti code on that is complimentary to the RNA code on to which it binds the first Mr in a code on is typically a yuji.\nattached to the end of the tna is the corresponding amino acid Matthias corresponds to the AU G code on.\nAndrew Ippolito: The large subunit of the rhizome now binds to create the PEPPER do or P site and the amino a CEO or a site alright, so they call it the videos site doesn't really matter the ideas is the piece site keeps the poly peptide.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys following us stills as making sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first TEE RNA occupies the p site, the second tra enters the a site and is complimentary to the second Mr an a code on bother to absorb this year so here's your start code on.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's The anti code on here's your initiator tra there is i'm assigning alright so right here's the key go see my mouse make sure it can.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's that's the piece site all right, the a site here you you a here's a second amino acid and so what's got is basically these two teams are shaped like there's like there's spooning like they're laying next to each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that the two amino acids are positioned precisely so that we can catalyze this bond right here so watch this.\nAndrew Ippolito: them assigning is then transferred to the site amino acid, the first try exits the ribosome moves along the RNA and the next TRT enters okay So you see how the entire poly peptide is transferred like a bunch of hot dog linked on a string.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's the basic the basic steps of elongation and you see how the ribosome itself is moving, while the tiara nice day still.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're staying so because of the hydrogen bonding as elongation continues the growing peptide is continually transferred to the a site tra the right moves along the Mr rene a new trn as enter.\nAndrew Ippolito: When I stopped code on his encountered in the a site a release factor enters the a site and translation is terminated when termination is reached, the right resumed associates, and the newly formed protein is released that's right so 100% of proteins are made this way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now you can go back to your cell biology chapter and remember rhizomes insert themselves into the rough er rhizomes are found in the cytoplasm floating around or rhizomes are in the mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: You also remember that there's ripe isms that prokaryotes have that are smaller than the rhizomes that you carry yourself and the ones that are the ones that are mitochondria are the smaller ones right, so our mitochondrial rivals and look, just like bacteria right.\nOkay. All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it's one o'clock, let me just kid just want to wrap this up now, since we're at one o'clock here alright so let's see that's it anything so we I taught you all this already you can just review these slides now.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah we talked about this is all really I throw these slides in here just for your own study after we reviewed all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the very last thing i'll say at the end of this is that once a protein is manufactured wants to probably peptide is manufactured that's not that's the beginning of it story.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so there's a whole world called post translational right after translation post translational modification.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys have already learned one phosphorylation remember some proteins are phosphor ELISE right remember G protein couple of receptors remember that.\nAndrew Ippolito: are a dental Cyclades or G proteins and remember that idea phosphor leading a protein to activate it so that phosphorylation event is considered a post translational modification.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, other proteins will need to be cut up to be activated so, for example, some enzymes are synthesized, but there are dormant until you cut a piece of them off to activate them.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, and so, at the end of the day, we can now say what a genius.\nAndrew Ippolito: What a mutation is right, we used to say that a mutation was something that changed a phenotype we can now say it's a change in the sequence of a gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's a gene it's a sequence of DNA that makes a piece of art.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's that and one thing we're not going to cover in any great detail the Semester, because we literally just can't fit any more into the class is this notion of RNA inhibition I will mention this when we do regulation next time but we're not going to spend any time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and that's that. Andrew Ippolito: This. Taylor Campbell: Chapter 17.\nAndrew Ippolito: You, this is the end. Andrew Ippolito: Of 17 yes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so next time we'll do chapter 18.

Andrew Ippolito: And we'll i'll teach you the lock up wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I would encourage you guys to get as far as you can on your own, we have a big gap here right so feel free to ask me questions, between now and Monday on your studying.\nAndrew Ippolito: On the lock opera, even though I didn't lecture on it, yet i'm totally okay teaching you guys over the weekend, if you want, if you're sitting there reading a study on your own and you pick my brain i'm here okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: put this link in the chat yeah yeah i'll definitely I can do that right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh here i'll put this in and zoom meeting, let me stop sharing my screen, so I can use my.\nAndrew Ippolito: Computer alright let's. See.\nAndrew Ippolito: There we go alright so that's the translation video.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are a ton of awesome animations out there for all this stuff right now, you guys have access to stuff I could only have dreamed up when I was in your seats so you'll you'll have a much quicker better way of understanding the stuff than I ever did, which is kind of Nice i'm a little.\nAndrew Ippolito: All this was when I was in this when I was in your seat all this was just picked static pictures and imagination, there was no animations at all, there were no computer anything, it was.\nAndrew Ippolito: very hard to understand. Taylor Campbell: I ask a question.\nNo. Andrew Ippolito: yeah, of course, got. Taylor Campbell: Just about like I guess the course.\nTaylor Campbell: It do you think we're like kind of stopped failing everything does do like you're like our exams and stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we hold on hold. Taylor Campbell: grudges or certain number of all the time. Taylor Campbell: And i'm just curious like is that something that always happens where do you think yeah.\nTaylor Campbell: So this happens it's not always. Andrew Ippolito: So keep keeping my so you're approaching this from the perspective that that raw score you get is your actual grade and I after the modified.\nAndrew Ippolito: That and so that's the wrong way to look at this the right way to look at this is these tests aren't perfect.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because we're sitting here in zoom and we're sitting here in a pandemic and i've never done it this way before and you've never done it that way before and we're all trying to figure out how to make this all work right, so it turns out.\nAndrew Ippolito: The people that have been teaching for like 20 years right people like Professor corn, she has honed her craft down to the point where she knows exactly.\nAndrew Ippolito: The kinds of questions that are asked and how much time it takes and how it covers lecture, to the point where her her exams would give her a number that she still has to adjust a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay Steve gosport we talk all the time he's constantly Every teacher has a technique to process the raw outputs that students okay so for these classes, the other struggle is.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys are this broad spectrum of students right you guys aren't all 18 with a specific SAP score and applied to the College and got accepted.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you think about a classic freshman class at temple or drexel or wherever, all those students are kind of homogenized right they're all about the same age, they have about the same high school GPA and experience and so.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're going to see a nice bell curve in that kind of situation with an agency, the average will be a C, and I mean that's you get what you said.\nAndrew Ippolito: What you see, is what you get in Community colleges because it's open access and anybody can register without the need of presenting things like evidence that they have prior learning all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know you guys have to take placement tests, but that that's about it, you get what's called a by modal distribution, so you can you can't see my screen anymore by mono distribution.\nAndrew Ippolito: And statistics that by modal distribution so here's your bell curve okay by modal looks like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, when you do, and I see this a lot and most tests megabytes I can see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have people that do really good or really bad and there's very few in between. Andrew Ippolito: And so, when you have by model distributions your averages sometimes get a little skewed because those bad scores are sometimes in the 30s or 20s.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you so when you see that average whatever it is, you have to keep in mind that that average is all all equal right, so the end people who zeros on it, because they didn't take it sometimes that gets averaged and depending on how I input it so.\nAndrew Ippolito: What I have to do is, I have to go in with a fine tooth comb with these tests and I have to find the questions that, for whatever reason Warren.\nAndrew Ippolito: Warren faithful to assessing you, in other words that question is not a fair way of me answering the question on my head did the student learn anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's that's what tests are their assessments and assessment is did the students learn the outcome of the class or the outcome of whatever the lectures so.\nAndrew Ippolito: No way of grading is perfect alright, so one on the way to do this is give you a bunch of multiple choice, and then a bunch of short answers or essays.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and when you do it that way, your essay questions tend to be higher scoring than the multiple choice and so those rescue the lower multiple choice.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when I was a freshman we were we were terrified we would have like hundred question multiple choice and it wasn't curved it wasn't adjusted, it was nothing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And after your test, you would go up like two or three days later, you go over to the board and you'd see your social security number.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is back in the 90s, and it would have a number next to it and that's what you got 8792 47 whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that was that, and so our freshman biology class we started all the students kept saying that freshman biology is the leading class it's so hard everybody's doing so badly when the reality is is there's so much to it it's so detailed and so.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have to make these kinds of adjustments so you're not so tell you're doing fine you're not doing you stop looking at the raw score as what I want to say so, the adjusted score is what me the Professor says the student earn.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, those aren't free points those aren't me giving you anything right what i'm giving a class for because of the pandemic is i'm bumping all your grades up that half letter grade.\nAndrew Ippolito: That and that's because of the the chaos that this is, but those adjusted scores when you go and take bio to, for example.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i've done this before I look at Joanne corns I actually I periodically asked her this, I have to ask her this again I haven't done in a while.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll see like So how are my students doing in your class, you know the ones that I like so you're going to go and take bio to at some point or some of you are, and some of you take her and so.\nAndrew Ippolito: She she she always says they do fine and she grades completely differently it's a different class right my litmus test is Am I preparing you guys for the next step, which is bio two and the answer that is yes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: Does that answer your question. Taylor Campbell: yeah thanks okay yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: So chin up you're doing good. Taylor Campbell: You are just doesn't feel good. Andrew Ippolito: I know I know and that's so really what I would probably rather do, and this is what some people do is they hide your final grades you don't know how you did on the test until I give you that adjusted score.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah and I actually used to do that, so if we were in person right the way the way test would work if you take the test on Monday right and then on Wednesday you come in on hand you a piece of paper.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that piece of paper would have a number at the top, you know at seven. Andrew Ippolito: And you'd be like immediately be done a seven that's pretty good and then you look at your raw i'd be like oh if if he didn't add points I would have gotten a seven YouTube or whatever, but you would have seen that second.\nAndrew Ippolito: But because we're in zoom and we're in canvas land here you guys see that you see the raw score immediately I could hide that and maybe I should do that next semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: for psychological reasons not logistical ones okay so imagine you saw your final grade before you're wrong grade, but you feel any different.\nTaylor Campbell: Somewhat I mean there's still just not good, you know what I mean like i'm there okay it's just I don't know, I just wish.\nTaylor Campbell: I don't know yes. Andrew Ippolito: Let me tell you another thing no not where I want to be like I just feel like.\nTaylor Campbell: Remember what I do like a try so hard and it just reflects a little and it just makes me upset so I was just curious if.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the test. Specifically. Taylor Campbell: Obviously it is everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then being recorded the quizzes. Taylor Campbell: Oh yeah I do terrible on. Andrew Ippolito: That are you talking about the homework can agree.\nTaylor Campbell: The labs oh yeah well the labs to is different because at least I can do it again if I do bad, but like seriously that.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can do the homework so again. Andrew Ippolito: You can we do the homework. Taylor Campbell: It takes me three hours to do that. Andrew Ippolito: yeah I wouldn't.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not suggesting, you should do that. Taylor Campbell: I just have a lot of like there's just so much you know, like I try and write down the notes and study the notes, I read the textbook I try and study that.\nTaylor Campbell: I do the homework, so I try and do that, and then I still do terrible and everything and it's discouraging it's just discouraging but.\nAndrew Ippolito: guys, you know I feel I feel you and i'm sorry that it's been that way, Jordan, did you put your hand up there are you waving goodbye.\nJordan Russell: Oh no I was clapping because I was. Andrew Ippolito: Oh you're a great hotel you're not alone you're not you're not alone.\nTaylor Campbell: And, and I think that's the biggest. Taylor Campbell: feel so alone because we can't even like. Taylor Campbell: You know interact with one another, like I have like a lab on campus for chemistry, and it was just so nice to like like work with another human being.\nTaylor Campbell: and be like okay well like i'm not crazy you're feeling how I feel, because you do feel stupid and I just hate it, so I didn't know that was something that just happens or probably just another.\nAndrew Ippolito: Terrible so well that's. Andrew Ippolito: Online that's a common feeling and all first year science courses science courses, especially the first ones, you know whether it's physics one calc one Chem one.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're you're not used to thinking like this right, these are this is different than English and psychology and sociology and all that stuff it's it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of it like martial arts in some ways, think of it like you're taking your brain and you're hurting it and punching it and and training it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just think, like a scientist and that's not something you do in a day or a month or a year it's slow and it's it's painful think about it, if it was easy everybody would do it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what you're feeling right now is the same way, somebody would feel when they first started training for something that's hard and their new right."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"The Plot of the TV Show","chunkSummary":"The two plots for the two characters are actually two separate books and they merge them together for the TV show.","start":"3:04:07","end":"3:04:13","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And so it turns out the the two plots for the two characters are actually two separate books and they merge them together for the TV show.\nAndrew Ippolito: But before I go too far on that there's the main character in the show Taylor is this girl who discover she has this latent talent and she's then she has to be trained to use this magic and she's around all these people have been training, since they were like three years old."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Introduction to the Main Character","chunkSummary":"The main character, Taylor, discovers she has a latent talent and needs to be trained to use magic.","start":"3:04:13","end":"3:04:30","content":"Andrew Ippolito: But before I go too far on that there's the main character in the show Taylor is this girl who discover she has this latent talent and she's then she has to be trained to use this magic and she's around all these people have been training, since they were like three years old.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so they're all making them look super easy so she's you know she's like I can't do anything and she just just broke she's like i'm useless at this and then eventually she gets the hang of it."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Taylor's Struggles and Growth","chunkSummary":"Taylor feels inadequate compared to others who have been training since a young age, but eventually improves.","start":"3:04:30","end":"3:04:41","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right and so they're all making them look super easy so she's you know she's like I can't do anything and she just just broke she's like i'm useless at this and then eventually she gets the hang of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so you're feeling growth pains are these are growing pains as a science person and it's totally normal I felt that way, I still remember the feeling I felt organic chemistry, I took that first test and it kicked my ass and I thought I knew it okay so."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Relating to Growth Pains","chunkSummary":"The lecturer shares their own experience of feeling overwhelmed in a science class and reassures Taylor that it's normal.","start":"3:04:41","end":"3:05:00","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right so you're feeling growth pains are these are growing pains as a science person and it's totally normal I felt that way, I still remember the feeling I felt organic chemistry, I took that first test and it kicked my ass and I thought I knew it okay so.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah I guess it just doesn't really feel like growing like I I see it, when i'm like."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 16 (Part 2) - Gene Expression","link":"https://youtu.be/IkqaiawzWDE?si=wVab7W8AL390y6-8","chunkTitle":"Taylor's Frustration with Learning","chunkSummary":"Taylor expresses her frustration with not feeling like she's growing or improving despite her efforts.","start":"3:05:00","end":"3:05:18","content":"Taylor Campbell: yeah I guess it just doesn't really feel like growing like I I see it, when i'm like.\nAndrew Ippolito: I like you're learning see I.

Andrew Ippolito: In a lot of ways, you would say they're not even regulated they're just always on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, this would be like plugging in you know let's say that you had some kind of Christmas lights you plug in the Christmas lights, to the energy source and then they're just not and there's no switcher button to turn them off.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you can say you have so so that's consistently always on right there's no such a genius always off we're not going to talk about that that would just be this might as well not be there, then right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then okay so of the genes that are on. whoops.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say they're. regulated.\nRegulated channels. Andrew Ippolito: And there's really there's there's two basic types, there are genes that are normally.\nAndrew Ippolito: Something. Andrew Ippolito: As opposed to can be something so watch this this is how we're going to do so they're normally on.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they can be turned off. Andrew Ippolito: Right or they're normally off, but could be turned on.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so give me give me an example let's play a little game here, give me an example of something in your House that's normally on but could be turned off.\nDanuta Despagne: What. Danuta Despagne: Light light. Andrew Ippolito: A light okay so give me a light that would be normally on but you could turn off.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, your kitchen lights. Andrew Ippolito: So some of us just leave our kitchen lights on all the time. Andrew Ippolito: All right, how about how about an appliance what kind of appliance think about your kitchen again what what appliance in your kitchen is like always on but you could turn it off if you really need to.\nDanuta Despagne: The fridge. Andrew Ippolito: perfect and that's the classic example I. Andrew Ippolito: use, so the vet your refrigerator. Andrew Ippolito: Your refrigerators on all the time, is always running right there's that practical joke you I don't know if you guys are actually paid tools are too young for.\nAndrew Ippolito: prank phone calls, which was a thing when I was a kid right you pick up the phone and somebody say hi, this is a refrigerator repair service, can you please check to see if your refrigerators running.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you'd be like yeah yeah it's running well, well then go catch it hi and they hang up.\nAndrew Ippolito: This prank prank calls were thing. Andrew Ippolito: And I just realized we've lost that happened we.\nAndrew Ippolito: We haven't oh Julia shaking her head vociferously oh so there are praying call still. Julia Lakchin: When I used to work at PF chang's week are praying calls not all the time, but it did happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay i'll say. Julia Lakchin: With them. Andrew Ippolito: I guess it doesn't happen on a personal basis anymore, we don't get calls anymore that are praying called randomly we just call that spam.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so now give me an example of something that's normally off, but we can turn on this is probably a little easier to think of.\nAngela Harbeck: Your toaster. Andrew Ippolito: Perfect that's the example I usually. Angela Harbeck: Give. The toaster.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, think of your hair dryer curling iron flashlight.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's here's the key the the words we use to describe these two states, the word we use is the can be word.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so ready a fridge that could be turned off his repressive.\nAndrew Ippolito: The toaster that could be turned on is in do simple.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those are the two words, so we have repressive systems, and we have been useable systems.\nAndrew Ippolito: The word describes the could be not the normal state.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Alexa Deprisco: You repeat that last part. Andrew Ippolito: share the word.\nAndrew Ippolito: In useable reproducible does it describes what could happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not what is currently the state right so through your fridge right now is replaceable.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because you could turn it off, you can repress it you could replace it you're not repressing it currently but you could so if you're not repressing it it's on the innumerable system is it could be turned on if we need it in a pinch, but right now it's tough.\nAndrew Ippolito: ask me more questions is this is the core right now, this is core stuff if we don't understand this, then everything else is going to start to fall apart.\nAngela Harbeck: So is this like talking about like RNA and DNA when it turns off and stuff.\nAngela Harbeck: This is yeah relying actor. Andrew Ippolito: yeah so here DNA. Angela Harbeck: To RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: RNA to protein we're talking about is the gene being expressed in that workflow or is it not expressed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so for the purposes, for the first purposes of this let's think about one more when it's off or putting the wall here when a gene is off, it is not being transcribed.\nAndrew Ippolito: transcription is not happening. Andrew Ippolito: For bacteria that's the majority of where they regularly is at that point whether or not the, Mr President.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So you have three types of genes, you have genes that are always on.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have genes that are usually on. Andrew Ippolito: And you have genes that are usually off for could be turned on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so always on usually on but could be turned off usually off, but could be turned on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay start thinking on this like your programming and computer to do things or your computer programming on robot."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 1) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/nOAw40wHet0?si=6ZWnSBAk3gRXMNxP","chunkTitle":"Negative Gene Regulation: The Lac Operon","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces negative gene regulation using the lac operon as a case study.

Andrew Ippolito: Right why, because we can knock it off when we need it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, good. Andrew Ippolito: As opposed to if it is in an offstage where the regulatory or i'm sorry the repress or protein was called are is not bound to the operator, and so the genes are on.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the whole secret to understanding the mechanism of op wrong control is whether or not that repress or protein is bound to the operator or not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so think of it like a think of it like a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Little blob that has crow's feet on it think of a bird on a wire. Andrew Ippolito: Right, and so the the birds hand is by default open or closed the caused by default open and then we can push a button to close it.\nAndrew Ippolito: or it's by default closed, and we can push a button to open it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it makes sense, now that we need a toggle switch for that repress or protein right, we need a way to change it state, we need to be able to either kick it off the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: If it's an unusable system. Andrew Ippolito: Or we need a way to put it on the DNA, there were three possible system right, so this is what distinguishes the useable and the repressive block ron's is the presence or absence of the oppressor protein and either ready or a Cobra presser.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so, something that is bound to it that keeps it there a Co represses so there's either a Cobra presser.\nAndrew Ippolito: or in the other kind of opera the invisible one there's something called the inducer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Both of these molecules or I should say either of these molecules depending on which system, it is will bind to the repress or protein and then switch it's normally on now it's off normally off now.\nAndrew Ippolito: And those names Cobra presser inducer go along with repress blend into specific.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so in inducer molecule would be in an indivisible opera. Andrew Ippolito: Read the code oppressor would be in the repressive will opera.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK questions. Andrew Ippolito: God.

Andrew Ippolito: You can see how everything's tied together these old ideas we had in our heads are now revisited so anabolic systems things that build.\nAndrew Ippolito: For example, we need to build an amino acid, so that we can make proteins we usually have to build those amino acids so trip to fan the trip hop around this T rp.\nAndrew Ippolito: That stands for trip to fan. Andrew Ippolito: which, as you recall trip the fan, which is amino acid w is one of the 20 amino acids, that we use to make proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the trip up around in bacteria is a metabolic pathway that builds trip the fan from building blocks.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of the beetle and tatum experiment that metabolic pathway, the city lean.\nAndrew Ippolito: To the Argentine. Andrew Ippolito: That was another type of anabolic pathway.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So you can generally associate anabolic pathways that the building this stuff that isn't there.\nAndrew Ippolito: With systems that are normally on, but it can be turned off if we suddenly have an influx of tryptophan right imagine you just ate a whole bunch of food that was very rich and trip to fail and so now the bacteria are flooded with trip to fan.\nAndrew Ippolito: They don't have to make it themselves anymore.

Andrew Ippolito: Think about a potato peeler.

Andrew Ippolito: The genes, the structural genes of the trip hop RON let's go over here you don't have to memorize these write the book does a very.\nAndrew Ippolito: Nice kind of glossing over things you have the trip EDC bna you don't have to again you don't have to memorize this, but those genes are enzymes involved in the synthesis of tryptophan.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so this is also an example of a negative feedback with the product of the pathway inhibits the pathway right, the product of all this district to fan and then tryptophan goes and shuts it all off.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is an example of a negative feedback loop.\nAndrew Ippolito: questions.\nApril Neeld: You said it was always off did you mean always on.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no.

Andrew Ippolito: Continuous continuity would be like hey did you see that last episode of Captain America winter soldier and did you like how like they talked about that one.\nAndrew Ippolito: character from the other movie that did that thing there's like continuity in the story that's continuous it doesn't necessarily physical continuity.\nAndrew Ippolito: contiguous is a word we use in physical terms okay contiguous means they're connected so, for example in adobe photoshop let's see that you had this landscape and adobe photoshop you have this beautiful picture of a tree and some clouds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and let's say that you want to change the color of the clouds. Andrew Ippolito: Right so there's a tool in photoshop this little the magic wand select your tool and let's say that when you clicked on when you when you select to use that tool there's a little there's a little checkbox up at the top of the program that says come to you with selection.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if you check that off. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and then I selected a cloud, you would see the dotted lines just appear around that cloud.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because you clicked that clouds inside and because the tool was set to contiguous it's only going to take what's connected to it until it hits a boundary.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if I unchecked it right here's the secret here if I uncheck contiguous button and I click the cloud i'm going to select all the clouds even though they're not physically connected to each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you would say ready now that you understand that concept let's look at think consider the extracellular domain of this protein this part here.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would describe that as discontinuous.

Andrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: let's walk back here.\nTo TV just bring this over here now. Andrew Ippolito: we're dealing with the immune system over there over here okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So TV has this DNA binding domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it has this activation domain.

Andrew Ippolito: we're modifying it right we're we're taking the histone protein and we're settling so here the cartoony version of a histone will be a circle, with a little tail on it like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that telus positively charged. Andrew Ippolito: This is what allows it to bind to the negatively charged DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the double standard helix is negatively charged and so they stick together spontaneously.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: We can mask this positive charge, we can cover it up by doing what's called an acetylene.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so, and so, basically, if this is the tale we're going to add in a pseudo group to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what this does is it masks the charge.\nAndrew Ippolito: It masks the positive charge.\nAngela Harbeck: We is this like when you talk about this tale, is it what we learned in Chapter 17 like when there's a bunch of a's on the end of the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh no no so that's that's the polycom. Andrew Ippolito: that's the. Andrew Ippolito: messenger RNA having a repeating a while yeah that that's called the ventilation, I can see how you totally that's a good connection Angela.\nAndrew Ippolito: You got the poly ventilation, this is a subtle ation and we're a subtle eating the tail so we're not making a tail Okay, the idea here is this let's say that my magnetic fields let's say this is a.\nAndrew Ippolito: histone and the very end of the last little bit of amino acids just kind of stick out like that, and these amino acids are all positively charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: Its history not that you have to know that, but these are groups here oh there's a little my little my little magnet here the our groups in here are all positive charges.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what we're gonna do is we're going to mask that charge by co vehemently attaching and a pseudo group at the end there that make sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, so you tell me now puzzle through this that not maybe not stanzel anybody puzzle through this what would be the consequence of adding an seo Group to the histone tail in relation to DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's play a game go ahead, Jordan. Jordan Russell: I mean doesn't it kind of SAVE right on the PowerPoint it opens the chromatin.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what do we mean by that like why. Why would it open the chromatin. Andrew Ippolito: what's the mechanism of action.\nAngela Harbeck: Well isn't DNA negatively charged So if you mask the positively charged, then I would open it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why, when you see it would open it up, but what it's what would that if if I mask the charge and then.\nAndrew Ippolito: What would that do to the relationship between the histone and the DNA.\nAngela Harbeck: Or did it make it like different. Andrew Ippolito: Well yeah change changes the relationship.\nAndrew Ippolito: They grew apart what i'm. Andrew Ippolito: What so Okay, the default state, we got the histone attached to the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: And the reason why is because we have a plus and a minus and they're sticking together.\nright here. Andrew Ippolito: So here's here's the schematic each one of these little purple balls is a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Little tadpole I guess is a histone protein, and so you can see these tales all stick out from the ads.\nAndrew Ippolito: If we hide these positive charges that will cause them to basically fall off the DNA that's the key or preventing them from sticking anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: So the history is going to fall off and it's going to open the DNA up.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, the key is we're making the histones go away.\nYou better. want to see a better picture here."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Histone Acetylation","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the process of histone acetylation, which involves adding acetyl groups to histone tails to mask their positive charge and promote the dissociation of histones from DNA, resulting in more open chromatin.","start":"38:51","end":"44:17","content":"You better. want to see a better picture here.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's too complicated i'm trying to find a simple version of it unfortunately there's really not.\nThese are all advanced molecular biology pictures.

Andrew Ippolito: they're called hot proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's. Andrew Ippolito: What that is going to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is knock. Andrew Ippolito: The histones.\nAndrew Ippolito: off the formal way of saying that would be if the associates the histone complex were dissociating the histones from the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what's going to happen is. Andrew Ippolito: The DNA would be more open, because the histones are now off because the histones are settling it.\nAndrew Ippolito: makes sense. Jordan Russell: So, so can we. Jordan Russell: say. Jordan Russell: Oh sorry Angela.\nAndrew Ippolito: No good good. Jordan Russell: So, like can we think that as like the a pseudo groups are pulling the like the tails out and then like pulling chunks of the histones out so that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Her yeah, why not that works if that's a visual for your brain yeah I like that yeah the basically yeah you're you're pulling it out by the tail because there's not it's not charged anymore so there's nothing sticking it there anymore okay Angela.\nAngela Harbeck: Would you want to say so, when they when the things.\nAngela Harbeck: The hats. Angela Harbeck: covered cover the positive charge and they start to unravel the histones are off of the DNA strand that's bound.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when the hats you this is what you would think the hat protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: transfers and a pseudo group to a history.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, if we had to think of this like a chemical reaction that has an enzyme the histones of substrate and you see the group is the substrate so grab some a Seattle from maybe acetylcholine who knows it grabs a set unless you know group and it puts it on to the histone tail.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so that's now these, and so the consequence of that is it doesn't like buying DNA anymore, because it's not a plus minus anymore okay alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: So the history, like full on comes off of the DNA comes. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah that's a great way think it just.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just falls off. Alexa Deprisco: it's like. Andrew Ippolito: Imagine you had an electromagnet stuck to a piece of metal. Andrew Ippolito: And you were able to flip the switch and then it just fell off because it's not magnetic anymore it's an electromagnet you.\nAlexa Deprisco: disable the battery or whatever people. April Neeld: So just for clarification, the hat what's the a Seattle on the end of the tail yes and that's all it does, because it has done will fall off on by itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because yeah that's an. Andrew Ippolito: that's an exact way of thinking, all by side, I like how you said that all by itself it's just this is a spontaneous reaction, naturally, the histone buying to the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: You just mix them in a test tube they're naturally going to form has done nuclear isms. Andrew Ippolito: This that's a spontaneous reaction when you bring the high protein in there and I used to meet up to do this to it staples it on to the histone tail and then it just completely associates alright alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: So I had a follow up question to that because, like at one way in the Semester you'd said that like DNA doesn't exist me get."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Histone Methylation","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains how DNA methylation can lead to the inhibition of gene expression by physically crumpling the chromosome and making the DNA less bioavailable.","start":"44:17","end":"49:31","content":"Alexa Deprisco: So I had a follow up question to that because, like at one way in the Semester you'd said that like DNA doesn't exist me get.\nAlexa Deprisco: It doesn't really you know because that's like unstable so like is this like a stable place for DNA to be like is problematic or.\nAndrew Ippolito: What you're not learning is that there is a host a host of other proteins that are also binding to DNA, which is why okay so just Just to give you a brief idea of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this I just grabbed some some random review Article.

Andrew Ippolito: And now think about the price of wheat for a farmer in Pennsylvania.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that farmer that's buying the wheat has to deal with price fluctuations and he asked the question why is my wheat changing and price today.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's connected to what people are doing in China right now in the war going on in Tanzania and this the right it's an insanely complex i'm just making all that up by the way, so you've probably heard the phrase like what's that have to do with the price of apples in China.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe that's a term people don't use anymore, and the idea is is that. Andrew Ippolito: what's going on with those coin today it's connected to everything everything's like everything and it's insanely complicated, so what we do, because we're just simple humans is we like telling stories and simplifying things.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we we talked about you know ilan musk is going Sarah live on Saturday night and that's why those coins going up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, that's what's going on right now so i'd be excited to know like when I watched this a month for an hour we watch.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's going to happen is everyone thinks that the price of those planes gonna crash on Saturday, because that's what everybody's expecting it to do, and so he's probably going to search.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it's probably going to search i'm going to sell it so it's gonna crash so it's a self fulfilling prophecy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in other words the economy like jeans is insanely complicated or think of the weather.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, whether. Andrew Ippolito: The economy and the inside of yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are what are called chaotic systems, they are called non linear dynamic systems there's a whole math behind all that that's part of what chaos theory is okay it's interesting this crazy our Angela I know you've had your hand up so ask your question sorry.\nAngela Harbeck: So it's like transcription is the histones still on the DNA, are they off the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're off the DNA and then I probably get right back on the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, yes, like if you're looking at that that picture.\nAndrew Ippolito: here. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the idea is. Andrew Ippolito: Is that proteins are probably going to a satellite this and knock them off.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that the transcription can occur. Andrew Ippolito: And then the opposite, so the there's always a gang to the onion right the opposite of a hat protein is going to do what functionally what is the opposite of a hack and I do, do you think.\nAngela Harbeck: mask it to be negative. Angela Harbeck: well. or nothing thinking. Andrew Ippolito: it's going to undo what the hat it right it's going to take the subtle group off.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we have histone subtly says. Andrew Ippolito: Only here we have histone DSM releases.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they're called each decks hd AC which is on the slide here."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Complexity of Chromatin Regulation","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito highlights the complexity of chromatin regulation, with numerous proteins and factors involved in controlling gene expression and chromatin structure.","start":"49:31","end":"52:43","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And they're called each decks hd AC which is on the slide here.\nApril Neeld: Where is it where is it. here.\nAndrew Ippolito: hd so we, so this is how you would draw your wiring diagram that you guys are probably building in your notes, hopefully.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea would be this ready. Andrew Ippolito: So we'll see gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's build this carefully let's think about it histone.\nAndrew Ippolito: What relationship with the histone have to the G. Andrew Ippolito: By let's say it, but when when histones are bound to the gene region would that be a negative inhibitory repressive or that be activating.\nAndrew Ippolito: likes to say it. Alexa Deprisco: Negative negative good. Andrew Ippolito: Right so histones inhibit gene expression.\nAndrew Ippolito: By virtue of just binding to them and hiding them crumbles up the DNA right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So how proteins are Dryden green because we associate green with go right, so you could you could be messy and do this but let's not do that.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's do this. Andrew Ippolito: Number repressing them oppressor. Andrew Ippolito: Remember, when we drew this kind of diagram for the lack operand we talked about.\nAndrew Ippolito: How low lactose inhibiting the repression of it. Andrew Ippolito: Right right we said Allah lactose.\nAndrew Ippolito: binds to the oppressor protein which in turn inhibits the laptop wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: So by the presence of Allah lactose is an inducer molecule because it inhibits the inhibitor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or, just like imagine something in your car blocking you from getting to the brake pedal. Andrew Ippolito: That would have the consequence of making you roll forward.\nAndrew Ippolito: Forget the gas pedal just you're not allowed to use the brake pedal okay good alright so.\nAndrew Ippolito: histone dia satellites.\nAndrew Ippolito: just going to activate the histone.\nAndrew Ippolito: So these kinds of diagrams are really useful because they reveal the underlying mechanisms.\nAndrew Ippolito: In a you know, in a broadway.\nAndrew Ippolito: Any questions.\nApril Neeld: So what is the htc do exactly.

Andrew Ippolito: So this T alright this and white here.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll put it up here. Andrew Ippolito: This D.\nAndrew Ippolito: A subtly it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: The histone tail. Andrew Ippolito: It basically reverses what the hat protein does.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's an opposing force and that's the concept that you have to see here because you're going to see this all over the place, think about ETF and rb they're opposing forces.\nAngela Harbeck: You say dia satellites it's just it's taking the silly assimilation and like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Taking it off basically breaking the Bob exactly it's breaking the Kobe on bond that sticks out there.\nAngela Harbeck: Go ahead Alex. Alexa Deprisco: So this is all in the context of like the histone tail like what happens to the rest of the histone.\nJust hanging out.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know the the 3D structure of it it's so it's binding to his his partner histones number is an October.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you know there's other things that can happen to you so so The other thing that can happen is it can be methyl aided so let's go back to the slide here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And let me. Andrew Ippolito: yeah okay so let's let's revisit this picture I pasted them before for a second and you all want to do is call your attention to the to the bright red thing right there.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, the m's here the me the red and means Okay, do you notice how these little red circles are drawn on this picture along the DNA itself to see how it's attached to the DNA it's not touching the histones great so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is DNA methylation. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, it happens on.\nAndrew Ippolito: guanine usually. Andrew Ippolito: Okay methodology and remember the five prime cap of RNA messenger RNA okay that CAP is methylation gwatney right, so the idea is when you mentally things when you mess like nucleotides that tends to inhibit them.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so enzymes can't see them and then this is there a hydrophobic residue rate methyl groups are just carbon ch three method method method right ch so it's hydrophobic it removes all all charged in the area, and so a more permanent way of inhibiting gene expression.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is by methylation the DNA and what this does is it crumbles the chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: like this is how you really get the. Andrew Ippolito: crumple it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so histone acetylene. Andrew Ippolito: is a really it's like a switch it's easy to on and off right histones and eat hats in each backs, we can turn things on turn things up things on track things up methylation is when you want to kind of just shut everything down and keep it that way.\nAndrew Ippolito: But not permanently permanently let's say long term like your life.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's permanent now if your kids. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so we can have methylation in our genome that turn genes off, but then something can happen on the course of our life we could take chemicals into our body that will change methylation patterns.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right cigarette smoker example. Andrew Ippolito: cigarette smoke will completely change gene expression in terrible ways.\nAndrew Ippolito: But one of the one I like tragedies of smoking cigarettes it shuts off genes involved the DNA repair so not only is it a carcinogen, not only is a damaging the DNA it's shutting off the genes that fix it.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a double hit So if you smoke cigarettes I would be like I would suggest just don't do that anymore that alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: branching off of that is kind of off topic, but like I think they say that there's like arsenic in cigarettes and.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh yeah there's tar. Alexa Deprisco: Lead arsenic. Andrew Ippolito: The so there's there's toxins there's poisons there's carcinogens there's so many bad things and cigarette smoke it's just.\nAlexa Deprisco: Well, I had to do a project on like brown water pollution in India and like 30 shallow wells that really polluted with arsenic and like that itself was like passed down genetically to like the kids you know who haven't even drink ours.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah. Alexa Deprisco: yeah yeah. Andrew Ippolito: Are there they're called spoil banks when you when you mind into the earth and you pull out stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: A lot of what's coming out you're just throwing it by the river and then it gets into the river and a lot of that stuff includes things like arsenic, our bodies never have all the ways to get rid of heavy metals.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the key so our bodies don't know what to do with them, and so we sequester those. Julia Lakchin: molecules and those.\nAndrew Ippolito: atoms. Andrew Ippolito: in different parts of the body and those leads to all sorts of problems that's lead poisoning.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I think of loose carol's mad hatter remember the mad hatter from Alison Wonderland That was the thing people, those those those top hats that people weren't during you know.\nAndrew Ippolito: Elizabeth and he thanked her they had a lead ring lining the CAP that would be basically stuck to your head.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason was lead is really soft malleable and so you can you can it's very form fitting, and so they would forfeit the top that's why the top hats looks so nice.\nAndrew Ippolito: The problem is, is the lead with leach into the skin and it would slowly make their brains bad and they would go crazy the mad hatter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mercury. Andrew Ippolito: Julia good. Julia Lakchin: going off of that real quick, did you hear that they wanted fan cigarettes with.\nJulia Lakchin: what's it called. Andrew Ippolito: Do me a favor tell closer to your microphone you're really kind of tinny.\nJulia Lakchin: i'm going off of that can you hear me better. Julia Lakchin: Now.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can i'm sorry Julie, I can understand you because the microphone where's your Mike right now, where is it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's why okay you're using one of those fancy hybrid things.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think april's coming to get you. Andrew Ippolito: you're both on the move.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah. Julia Lakchin: Okay, can you hear me. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, oh. Okay.\nJulia Lakchin: i'm going on. Andrew Ippolito: watch out for April I think she came. Andrew Ippolito: she's coming to get you.\nJulia Lakchin: They want to ban cigarettes that have methanol in them, did you hear about that. Andrew Ippolito: Oh yeah no all methods methanol supposedly just makes it taste better I think it's a flavor additive.\nJulia Lakchin: yeah but so many people smoke it so i'm just thinking if you're already going to ban methanol on cigarettes cigarettes.\nJulia Lakchin: Oh well, yeah they're going to be different. Andrew Ippolito: that's a different year that's so so banning methanol.\nAndrew Ippolito: makes them. Andrew Ippolito: Less enticing to younger people.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the idea is. Andrew Ippolito: You. Andrew Ippolito: Make it slowly slowly over time, reducing the rates by making less fewer people smoking.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah I agree, they should ban cigarettes, but that, then you know, then you start getting into the you know freedoms, personal freedom like I should be allowed to smoke in my own House.\nAndrew Ippolito: But then you're like what about your kids what your car, what about your kids in the car, you know but we're being on we've i'll tell you, we have come such a long way.\nAndrew Ippolito: When I was excellent my mom and dad smoke growing up, I can't step I get a whiff of cigarette smoke I get angry I have like ptsd from it, I can't even be near the smell of it, I can't and.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, which was a problem when I was in college, because when I went to college, you know when you go to the bars and you go social everybody was the bars were just closed a small, and I was really hard for.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I still remember, I think, was my junior year they banned indoor smoking and I was like oh my God like and I remember the first time I went out, I was like.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is wonderful like I can like think and talk to people and socialize without these clouds of smoke and you know, then everybody be outside smoking, you have to walk through the clouds of smoke, which was disgusting but much less disgusting.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the idea of banning it all together that goes into American freedoms people wanting to freedom, to hurt themselves, you know.\nApril Neeld: Well it's it's like it's like other drugs like they're gonna find it on the street and it's probably going to be laced with something even.\nAndrew Ippolito: Worse right yeah yeah it's great it's highly regulated that's a good point. Andrew Ippolito: Well it's they're highly regulated where they're they're highly taxed in on a lot of that tax dollar goes to the health care costs that it causes.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah that's people, this is this is how I do it right, so I don't judge people for the things they do everybody has their vices right my thing is, we all have to find a way to get through this tragedy recall life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Everybody has their own coping mechanisms and some are healthier than others, and some people figure it out, and some people don't right exercising as a coping mechanism for some people and heavy drug use as a coping mechanism for others, some mechanisms are more successful than others."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Considerations on Methanol in Cigarettes","chunkSummary":"Students raise questions about the potential ban of methanol in cigarettes and its impact on smoking habits and bioavailability of cigarettes.","start":"1:02:14","end":"1:04:57","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Everybody has their own coping mechanisms and some are healthier than others, and some people figure it out, and some people don't right exercising as a coping mechanism for some people and heavy drug use as a coping mechanism for others, some mechanisms are more successful than others.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: And then addiction is. Andrew Ippolito: Is there are genetic predispositions.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's it and it is a disease and that's the appropriate way of viewing it in my opinion it's not like oh just stop doing it like that's not how it works Angela.\nAngela Harbeck: And I have two questions so like with methylation so it just kills the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just what the DNA. Angela Harbeck: Is a kill the DNA. Andrew Ippolito: No, no, no, no, it masks the DNA from its environment, think about oil and water okay so remember the inside of the cells fill with water right everything's got water and so everything has kind of been than an aqueous solution right and so anything that is neutrally charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: is going to form you guys remember in your chemistry remember crowding forces.\nAndrew Ippolito: You remember hydrophobic interactions the idea of that negative charge i'm sorry that neutral molecules will tend to crowd together.\nAndrew Ippolito: being surrounded by the positive molecules so the effect of methylation DNA is to physically crumple it up, and the same way, oil and water react with each other, it takes it away from the solution and so anything in biology you guys can just file it away in your head any molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you want it to not react with things you want to make it less reactive.\nAndrew Ippolito: You reduce its charge or its polarity. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, when we find some kind of fancy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Therapeutic in the plant kingdom, one of the things that chemical engineers do is they analyze the chemical structure of that thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they look for problem parts to it, what parts are to hydrophobic because when we take it into our bodies, we need it to get into our blood or but across the blood brain barrier, we need it to be bioactive so we call this bio availability.\nAndrew Ippolito: Drugs are more bioavailable or less bioavailable based on their charge and methylation is a really effective way of rendering it less bioavailable.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it because of. Andrew Ippolito: Oil it's a simple mechanic hydrophobic. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, then think about liquids being inside and water, think about.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anything we've talked about all semester about. Andrew Ippolito: hydrophobic okay so we're making the DNA hydrophobic when it's normally very hydrophobic it's it's an.\nAngela Harbeck: it's an acid right.

Andrew Ippolito: Yes, okay okay that's from the first slide right here, I just borrowed each one.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah yeah okay. Taylor Campbell: It just follows it like is that, like, why is there no arrow with the second one was that on purpose.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, you mean right here. Andrew Ippolito: yeah no it's not on purpose what I did here when I wrote this slide I said so histones are associated with the idea of a subtle ation and a subtle ation is associated so these arrows are so just mental association hours.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah and he said how those ones aren't they're independent.

Andrew Ippolito: it's controlling the cell cycle, we sequence it we plug it into a blast search and boom there's a human version of it, and when we go back to the human genes and we look at those cells, we find that same protein and they're doing the same thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: That self discovery works. Andrew Ippolito: it's one of the ways discovery work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's move on here so that level of control that we're talking about chromatin structure, this is the broadest level of gene control we're talking about turning a whole bunch of genes on or a whole bunch of genes off.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.

Andrew Ippolito: you're like now I can't see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the key to EPI genetic inheritance, is that it's any inheritance beyond the level of genetic, in other words it's it's beyond the level of the DNA sequence.\nAndrew Ippolito: A simple example would be inheriting a methylation pattern.\nAndrew Ippolito: and honestly for our for our purposes that's all going to give. Andrew Ippolito: You will learn about epigenetics when you take genetics, which would be your next that will be a sophomore level class after bio one and bio do.\nAndrew Ippolito: You should we I, and I really wish we offer genetics and i'm going to start pushing for them, where you can take genetics and mongo I wouldn't recommend that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because the person who teaches it I don't think is somebody who should be teaching modern genetics.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's that's a rabbit hole I don't want to go into right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: The last time I looked at this curriculum he's still teaching techniques, we use to map mouse genomes back in the 90s, which.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's better things to be studying right now, then historical anyway i'm not good not good that's a mouse hole i'm not going to go down that now so okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right Okay, and we just suddenly do that on okay so that's that's epigenetics you guys got these slides were that's all i'll say about that.\nAndrew Ippolito: next level, so what we're doing here now is we're going, let me use all this back to this slide here now we're dealing with this and we've already kind of covered this raid so we're now.\nAndrew Ippolito: To satisfy Julie is linear version of all this we're gonna go and we're going to look at this one more time, and this is where falls into the normal story.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription which by the way, that's the default level when we just say that gene is regulated or that gene has mutated or that thing is turned off we're talking about it's no longer transcribed.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the default way of talking about alright, so, if you look down at the bottom here here's here's us leveling up a little bit on understanding the anatomy of a G okay so let's revisit first what we already know there's your promoter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and remember the promoters what binds to transcription factors that bind that recruit the RNA polymerase to Okay, which is why what I would do if I was making this slide is I would actually highlight this.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's my version of a promoter because you see how my version of the promoter includes the proximal control elements.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because those things by the transcription factors and recruit the RNA polymerase so I don't understand why.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some molecular biologists decide to pull this apart i'm sure there's a good reason for it. Andrew Ippolito: i'm not actively involved in the field anymore so i'm sure that those who have been studying this longer and deeper than I have have a reason for this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So don't you know don't take that to your next class and tell them that you're actually Dr I says you're wrong like now i'm probably wrong some reason for some reason.\nAndrew Ippolito: But really the promoter reason of the gene is that's that's a regulatory area that's the part that protein bind to and turn it on or off.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it includes consensus sites for DNA transcription factors for transcription all right, then there's your in transit excellence there's your poly ventilation signal.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: And then, somewhere, you have this termination region.\nAndrew Ippolito: And right far far away alright, so now let's so that's all downstream let's look upstream now right remember these double slashes mean far far away so upstream, we have this little think of it like a cartridge it plugin again this gene cartridge this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Genetic cartridge that has these little yellow lines here, these are also control elements and they're far away, so we call these distilled control outlets and so this region we call an enhancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and here's how you draw an enhancer this is it's such a simple way to think of it when once you see this you're going to love it ready remember dinis like a wet spaghetti noodle.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the traditional way of seeing this is here's the promoter here's the or the open reading frame and it's down over here is the enhancer you're like well how on earth does the enhancer do anything well watch this.\nAndrew Ippolito: There you go. Andrew Ippolito: it's 3D so here's your enhancer bonnie some proteins here's your promoter that's how it enhances transcription.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, a more advanced take on this would be right here downstream from the enhancer are these regions called boundary elements.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll learn about this when you take molecular biology someday all a boundary element is think of it like a bookend.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, in other words the boundary element prevents that enhancer from controlling other genes enhancers tend to be associated with one.\nAndrew Ippolito: This enhancer helps that gene and part of the reason why that works is there are these other proteins remember right so let's go back to your original question about all these other proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are boundary element proteins that help organize the DNA and so those boundary all men proteins will basically keep all of this relatively together and intact.\nAndrew Ippolito: But go ahead and ask a question off mute I can read those that was. April Neeld: too complicated for. Andrew Ippolito: Real lip reading.\nAlexa Deprisco: So the enhancer that's downstream of that and, like this is this is on one gene. Andrew Ippolito: Right, yes, yes, this is, this is one genetic area.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you be careful, though, if I took this gene and I moved let's say I went through a chromosomal translocation and I moved that gene far away.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's no longer you would say this it's no longer under the influence of that enhancer. Andrew Ippolito: It still works, it might be under the control of a different enhancer now, or it might not have any enhancer and be poorly regulated.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's still it's gene though okay so don't confuse the word gene with whatever the hell, this whole thing is I don't have a word for that genes are controlled by enhancers okay collectively we call them regulatory elements, the genome is littered with regulatory elements.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so. Andrew Ippolito: enhancers enhance gene expression.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they don't they're not an absolute requirement and not all genes have them.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, think of it like this, some jeans need a little extra help.\nAndrew Ippolito: or hurt anybody watched shadow and bone yet. Andrew Ippolito: No Alexis was Washington I don't know if she's here right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the idea of So if you if you use magic you're a wizard or whatever the grecian these you can have what's called a an amplifier.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so, if you have an amplifier your magic is now 10 times more powerful so think of that the enhancer as an amplifier it's an amplification I means of making the gene even more expressed April.\nApril Neeld: So does the enhancer bind to the promoter or is it just kind of next to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like one is in that there's proteins that think of it like a swarm of proteins. Andrew Ippolito: That then work with the transcription machinery.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: yeah so like a cleaner way of doing it would be.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are some proteins here. Andrew Ippolito: And there are some proteins here and they're talking to each other.\nAngela Harbeck: what's the enhancer like what's the definition for it again. Andrew Ippolito: enhance enhance it enhances gene expression.\nApril Neeld: Do we have to know how it enhances you. Andrew Ippolito: know. i'm just.\nAndrew Ippolito: So i've said all this i'm just going to go through the slides here, we talked about the fact that plumbers doesn't bind the Dean, indirectly, and so you have transcription factors so there's general transcription factors I was calling these bazell the bazell machinery.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so general transcription factors are bazell transcription factors that are just semantics dif different words to say the same thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so general transcription factors are essential for all protein coatings yes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some transcription factors bond to the top box others bind to others. Andrew Ippolito: Right so it's actually the woman, I worked with in Grad school was the code nine she was the second one that discovered so she was scooped that's what they call it she's not famous because of this reason she discovered what are called.\nAndrew Ippolito: test harness promoters. Andrew Ippolito: what's really funny way of putting it right so before we discovered these we thought all jeans at the top box.\nAndrew Ippolito: But she discovered that there were some functional jeans jeans that gave rise to protein products that did not have a did not seem to have a ta ta site and their promoter.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so they didn't use tcp. Andrew Ippolito: They use another protein that we learned called SP one.\nAndrew Ippolito: So half the genes use pvp the other half us as people. Andrew Ippolito: And SP was part of the genesis of general transcription but.\nAndrew Ippolito: She might beg to differ she called a specific line so whatever we're getting into hand waving at this point.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And we talked about these already.\nAndrew Ippolito: ETF SP one i'm sorry eat.\nAndrew Ippolito: And rb Jean Pierre be.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so, an activator is the opposite of our oppressor activator proteins a bind and they are so active meters combined to either the enhancer or the promoter, the idea is they just helped the gene go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and all activated one of the hallmarks just like you remember receptors right receptors have a receptor domain that binds to the leg leg and binding domain and they have a trans membrane domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: transcription factors that are activated have a DNA binding domain and activation domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, they have a DNA binding domain and they have an activation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And those would be continuous.\nAndrew Ippolito: Any questions. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, this would be a real world example of a transcription factor. Andrew Ippolito: The genes name is my God or the proteins name is my God, and you can see here it's a very simple protein there's two so it's a header it's a hormone diametric protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you can see one pilot peptide folds up into what's called an alpha loop or helix loop helix so you can just do it all this one is a loop a loop like that, and so, think of a pair of scissors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I mean this this does kind of look at the end of the day, like a pair of scissors.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, each one of these. Andrew Ippolito: Is a folded up 3D poly peptide it Dima rises and now it's got.\nAndrew Ippolito: This region, right here, though, it looks like the scissors that are open that just slide right into the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you see this right here, you remember the major and minor group of DNA. Andrew Ippolito: Right tell you that so here if I was to just draw this again.\noops. Andrew Ippolito: Sorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is the minor by the i'm sorry, this is the minor groove. Andrew Ippolito: And this is the major group so here the major groove is right here, see that so just picture, this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: My my model DNA doesn't have the major minor grimace to symmetrical but basically the space here in here, so if I had a protein bound like this that would be a major groove binding protein this protein the single alpha helix loops right in here, this is a minor groove binding protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, this part of the protein is its DNA binding domain and this part of the protein is is activation domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So over oppressor protein would be a protein that has a DNA binding domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: But not an activation domain right that just makes sense, just pop off the activation domain, a got an oppressor alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: And the dynamics 30 module said that my God was something that promoted muscle cell development is that.\nAlexa Deprisco: Sagan said, my God promotes muscle cell development by turning on the expression and multiple muscle related to something we should hold on to.\nAlexa Deprisco: You don't have to know that. Andrew Ippolito: It is that true, yes, but do you have to know that for the test no but that that's it's a good example of a specific factor right it's my God is only involved.\nAndrew Ippolito: In turn, genes on so so muscle cells have a set of genes that make the muscle cells, and this is the transcription factor that gives them muscle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so every other cell in the body has those genes there they're just turned off.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe they're even methylation who knows that would be an example of a good use case for methylation right your neurons have absolutely no need for muscle cell jeans, so why not methylation them all.\nAndrew Ippolito: keep them all off forever making less likely to right we we don't ever want to turn genes on that shouldn't be on right that's part of the cancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so our oppressor protein, some of them will act indirectly by influencing chromatin structure, so you would say that he backs i'm sorry, you would excuse me, you would say that i'm H Dax our oppressor proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why they remove the subtle group they let them the histones stick right so that's the repression.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, some of them might dress the bind the DNA. Andrew Ippolito: And they basically compete for the same sites that the activator is do so, think of it like competitive inhibition right and so that idea there of rb repressing and he to F activating they're both binding to the same binding site.\nAndrew Ippolito: who's ever their wins.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then still other oppressors might bind to the activator before they get to the DNA and sequester them.\nAndrew Ippolito: So imagine, something that binds to eat and prevents it from bonnie to DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: turns out rb does that, too, I don't want to get too complicated so rb bites of DNA but also rb by ctf and prevents he to fit DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's a complex between rb need to have."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Gene Regulation","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the concept of gene regulation and the different levels at which it occurs.","start":"1:37:06","end":"1:39:43","content":"Andrew Ippolito: That each bind to a different protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: And maybe even multiple proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: So just step back and digest that for a second. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, we can have multiple transcription factors bind to the same promoter.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so let's just for our pretend example here say that the top ones here are the activator, and these are oppressors.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when a is bound to the DNA it activates the gene or I should say it contributes now we're gonna have to think about contributing to remember the idea.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the inducer we had double we had two lovers there right and remember what we've talked about like if cyclic amp D levels were high in the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And lactose levels were high in the cell, we would have the crypt protein helping and the oppressor off and so that would be fully expressed.\nAndrew Ippolito: right that was that was just two lovers now we're talking about 12 lovers up to 12 lovers OK, so now, you can think of it's when you add it all together, you basically get a dial.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that dial could be set too high medium, you know it has a bunch of tick marks.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think of a treadmill speed controller, you can set the treadmill to one or 1.1 or 1.2 or 1.3 all the way up to whatever 15.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you can't set it to 1.1 to five, but you can set it to 1.7 so there's some amazing level of control there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Most of our genes are like this. Andrew Ippolito: And so you can think of the promoter as a barcode.\nAndrew Ippolito: So whatever this gene is. Andrew Ippolito: When it is under this kind of control called combination of control.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can highly refined. Andrew Ippolito: The gene expression, you can turn it on a little bit a little bit more a little bit more, you can maximize it and everything in between.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember the goal of all this is to save energy right. Andrew Ippolito: And so, in are insanely complicated bodies with are insanely complicated cells and are insanely complicated tissues and insanely kaput immune systems and hormone controls, it stands to reason that we have to have an insane level of control over our genes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is where the meat of it all is.

Andrew Ippolito: of knowledge.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is why i'm going to still stick to the idea that we're going to need artificial intelligence to really pull us apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: and understand that there's a realm of biology that you might go into someday it's an emerging field it's not it's it's has since emerged is closed systems biology."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Post-Transcriptional Control","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains post-transcriptional control mechanisms such as alternative splicing, regulation of poly(A) tail length, and nuclear export.","start":"1:46:25","end":"1:49:57","content":"Andrew Ippolito: and understand that there's a realm of biology that you might go into someday it's an emerging field it's not it's it's has since emerged is closed systems biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, for those of you who have the brain for math and logic and computer programming and you're like this stuff this might be your field of choice systems biology has the very aspirational goal of understanding life at the system's level.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna have to understand all this to recreate it at some point in the lab.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or at least to understand that well enough, so we can solve the problems we deal with.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's see what this, I just want to read through this really quick see there's anything useful in here, I think this is just basic transcript y'all here okay here's here's how enhancers work so i'll do i'll run this little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll put the sound on to you, so you can hear it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here we go. Most of the fine tuning of gene expression occurs at the transcription level making an RNA copy of a DNA sequence.\nrecall that to initiate transcription and RNA polymerase must bind to the promoter region adjacent to a gene.\nThis cannot occur without the help of specific protein transcription factors some transcription factors called activator bind to enhancer regions some distance from the gene.\nThe DNA ben's bringing the activator is closer to the gene where the activator is interact with other transcription factors and RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I love his videos they just end.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, alexa. Alexa Deprisco: In our book on page 375 and reference to like how it begins to reach the enhancer it talks about a DNA bending protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: sure. Andrew Ippolito: there'll be proteins right here that help contort the DNA they're probably till boy some races generically they're all called chromatin.\nremodelling. and\nAndrew Ippolito: An example would be what I said earlier, there's the. Andrew Ippolito: there's swift there's the switch what's the acronyms.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's been too many years which sniff complex hold on.\nI misspelled that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Complex there it is. Andrew Ippolito: Here, if you really want to dig into this.\nAndrew Ippolito: put this in in the chat right there that's there's a wiki entry on it, but take it with a grain of salt, but.\nAndrew Ippolito: switch sniff deter ATP dependent chromatin remodeling complexes.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah they just help.

Andrew Ippolito: All right, any other questions.\nAll right. Andrew Ippolito: that's as hard as it gets the rest of this is kind of easy sailing.\nAndrew Ippolito: So transcription alone obviously doesn't cost the gene expression there's post transcription of processing there's the copy and detailing and the spacing and all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good stuff right so that regulatory mechanisms exist at every level past that so the key what I want you to be able to understand.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is I want you to be able to identify correctly, the level of control for a given math mechanism and other words let's go back to the very first slide this whole thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to be able to say that has an H dex work at the chromatin structure level transcription factors work at the level of transcription control.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alternative splicing works at the level of post transcription will control variation of those poly tales right, so I can just give this to you in a very simple summary here remember the poly a tail.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those can be long or short, they can vary in length from 50 to up to 250 different a's, and so the longer they are the longer that Mr and a will live.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because remember they're getting gobbled up there's like a bomb views so you can have variable length poly tail so that would be an example of post transcription will control.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Number alternative splicing the idea of the axon in tron shuffling around.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a level of post transcription control. Andrew Ippolito: And then really.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea of nuclear export Controlling the export of the RNA into the cytoplasm.\nAndrew Ippolito: would be the very last of these levels and post transcripts no control beyond that.\nAndrew Ippolito: All i'll say is there are proteins that can inhibit the translation from occurring.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think about a protein that prevents the ribosome from binding to the RNA, for example, so here remember we had.\nAndrew Ippolito: If this is our mature transcript so here's our five prime and here's our poly a tail here's our start code on right here there's a yuji here's our five prime on translated region here's our three prime on translator region there's other.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's the value tr imagine proteins that bind here.\nAndrew Ippolito: That prevent. Andrew Ippolito: The small ribas almost subunit.\nAndrew Ippolito: From binding. Andrew Ippolito: So you close translation and happier proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then here's another one, this is, this is probably the coolest if this is the RNA and this right here is the open reading frame Those are all the all the code ons imagine a piece of RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: That has complimentary to that. Andrew Ippolito: This would be antisense.\nAndrew Ippolito: RNA. Andrew Ippolito: And so that antisense RNA binds to the reading frame.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that does two things one it prevents the ribosome from reading along and but to this is very important cells, do not tolerate double stranded RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's double stranded RNA right there There we have an entire complex of proteins that shred double stranded RNA D s RNA.\nequals bad.

Andrew Ippolito: that's called a post translational modification.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's post translational regulation right I when you work in the field we generally just call them that's an example of post translational translate all modification.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's a your book talks about there's something called a pro enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: The pro enzyme is like a pre enzyme think about the poly peptide chain like this here's the end to see and let's see that right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the useful part that's the catalytic useful stuff is the enzyme part and then over here this part here just prevents it from working and so to activate this protein, we have to cleave it right here, we have to break that piece off.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, this part over here folds up into the right shape and that's your enzyme that's your activists on.\nAndrew Ippolito: This part just who know some i'm sure in some situations that has a function by itself, but just as far as we're concerned it gets broken down the amino acids get broken down and we used to make new proteins, that would be this would be another level of post translational control.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, another one number CD case, remember that CD case like the independent kinases they're always there but they're inactive.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the only way, you can activate a CD K, is to have the gene expression, give rise to a cycling protein that then goes and binds to the CD and that complex becomes reactive protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's another example of push translational modification or push translational regulation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: alright. Andrew Ippolito: So i'm going to teach you a few of these that we haven't talked about yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm just gonna teach you one more.

Andrew Ippolito: Remember those sit on the surface of your cells like your amb proteins or mhc That was the so examples of those would be your me see molecules those are involved in your immune system, the major histocompatibility complex, we talked about the A, B O blood some blood markers okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: we've associated these with histones. Andrew Ippolito: And we associate this with everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, everything is formulated.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's one more. Andrew Ippolito: it's called ubiquity.\nubiquity ubiquity. Andrew Ippolito: nation, you might see this sometimes written I don't like this, but this is what some people use you be queer tin no.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's no difference, it depends on who's talking about, it is a longer word Why not use the shorter word.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what ubiquitous. Andrew Ippolito: Does anybody know what the word ubiquitous means.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's it, this is, this is an English word This might be a word you're not familiar with this, so this is my quick little English lesson here you quit this when something is ubiquitous you be I Qu I to us.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say a. Andrew Ippolito: source code to right now as ubiquitous.\nAndrew Ippolito: oxygen gases ubiquitous. Andrew Ippolito: anxieties ubiquitous.\nAndrew Ippolito: zoom as ubiquitous remote classes are ubiquitous right now what's to me.\nVictoria Bloemker: it's like President. Andrew Ippolito: Well, but as President were.\nVictoria Bloemker: Like. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, that's. Andrew Ippolito: ubiquitous means it's everywhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the first researchers to discover this protein said hey guys look at this this proteins like literally everywhere let's call it ubiquitous and.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's where it gets his name from. Andrew Ippolito: Not very informative but that's why it's called that you can abbreviate it you be.\nAndrew Ippolito: ubiquitous a tiny protein think of it like a tag alright, so if this is, this is a normal protein let's say this is, you know, whatever act in or something or collagen or whatever ubiquitous in is this tiny little protein that gets added to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: In a product called ubiquitous nation Okay, and what this does is this serves as a signal to the cell that this protein is time to go we're going to break this protein down, this is a degradation flag.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, this is what happens when the cell says, I don't need this protein anymore it's been oxidizes little broken let's just get rid of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: ubiquity comes along and gets tagged as a there are ubiquitous transfer races, you know, to know about those just the idea of this cell ubiquitous these things, and so ubiquitous protein the generic version of that job or the generic impact of ubiquitous nation is it is marked for degradation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And where it goes. Andrew Ippolito: Is an Oregon now that I have been hiding from you all semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: like an Oregon now like, like the endoplasmic reticulum or the laces um it's it's called the proteas.\nAndrew Ippolito: I have no idea why your book does not teach you this and it's kind of a crime against biology students, because this thing is so important it's called the pro Deism ready watch.\nAndrew Ippolito: Pro to those employees, if your book does mention this somewhere tell me, because I have been unable to find it's not in the cell chapter."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Conclusion","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito emphasizes the complexity of gene regulation and the need for further research in the field.","start":"2:03:13","end":"2:06:05","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Pro to those employees, if your book does mention this somewhere tell me, because I have been unable to find it's not in the cell chapter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's an Oregon at all if you think i'm making this up true.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll show you a pretty picture of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright that's the 20 success protease.

Andrew Ippolito: This is distinct from the mutations you've already learned about remember a chromosome can be president or Apps in right, you can have trisomy or masami.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember, you can have deletions duplications trans locations insertions right Those are all the different that's chromosome level mutation now we're talking about individual nucleotides.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to go through these one, at a time, so you can use this right here, as part of like your study guide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but we're going to go through these one, at a time and I have these all set up nicely, where we have our we have our reference point there there's our DNA and we're gonna really is the RNA right we're talking about protein coding mutations in this case.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we're going to see we're just reading this right you you, you see you, you a you, you would you right, and so you see you stands for serious right.\nAndrew Ippolito: If we change that last amino acid sorry sorry that last nucleotide in the first code on if we change this where's my mouse we change this you to an A.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll see that it still stands for searing. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is called a silent mutation it's silent, because the protein hasn't changed at all.\nAndrew Ippolito: questions. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Next.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're taking we're using the same sequence throughout these examples. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to now change that you see you to AC so we go from searing the amino acids Syrian you see you, to the amino acid three me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Now so So the idea of changing one amino acid to another amino acid that is called a miss sense mutation it's like misspeaking.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, remember sense and anti sense, so this this just makes sense oops I made a mistake, this is miss sense i've said the wrong thing and there's two kinds of missiles mutations.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because Syrian and three mean turn out to be biochemically very similar we call this a conservative miss sense mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's conservative because you're in a three and enter very similar biochemically Okay, so if we look at those of the side chains, you can see that searing here is a carbon attached to a hydroxyl group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where it's three main as a carbon attached to another carbon. Andrew Ippolito: And the hydroxyl group so there's really you can think of Syrian maybe as i'm methyl latency or i'm sorry, you can think of three main here as methylation Syrian and we've added a methyl group to it so they're very, very similar.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so in the lab if you're, these are the amino acids that turn out to get phosphor elated.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so if you mutate a protein in lab you meet a Syrian and lab and you convert it to a three again you'll still see a good fastball related whereas if you so so that's a conservative Mrs mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: you'll also notice that searing the three inning differ just by a single base in our kota.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they're biochemically similar and the wobble effect kind of works on both sides of these code on so, in other words, we have a whole set.\nAndrew Ippolito: of code ons. Andrew Ippolito: For just these two amino acids right so there's remember that these are also amino acids that have more than four code ons Syrians got these four add another two over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and three mean also has whereas an AC see there's the other two for three inning there's three here i'm sorry there's 443 and in here a see you.\nACC JC a CG.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's why I did that. Andrew Ippolito: Right, the idea is for three inning and Syrian even their middle words, the same right, this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is see you, and this is see you. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so the idea is is these 10 code ons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are all functionally the same. Andrew Ippolito: Right 10 out of 64 code ons that tells you why they're so important.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, these are essential to life. Julia Lakchin: Do we have to know.\nAndrew Ippolito: like that, no, no, no, no, you have to know you have to memorize not just understand. Andrew Ippolito: The concept of a conservative misinterpretation.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the idea of its conservative because they're similar biochemically.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you would say there's point mutations within the point mutation so far we've learned silent and we've learned miss sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: Within miss sense mutations there's conservative and then we're going to learn what's the next one here we're gonna call radical.\nAndrew Ippolito: which, as you can, if you're following along, you can understand the radical because they have very different biochemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: right here so watch this we're going to go from ucu to you G and that turns that Syrian into assisting.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is a radical misinterpretation, we have dramatically altered the biochemistry of that amino acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's the side chain of Syrian that oh each group, and you can see that 16 instead as a self hydro group attached to it which you can't fast for all eight and actually that that engages in sulfur bonds right the Member a salt bridges or die die sulfide bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you're definitely going to break the protein whatever it originally did it's going to now not do that maybe there's something cool and new but chances are i'll just not working that's bad.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, the nonsense mutation don't think of it like nonsense, like the word nonsense think of it like no there's no sense there, in other words we're making a new stop code on we're making there's ago so i'm going hga which normally encodes friend amino acid and we're making it stop.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it's nonsense, because no additional translation occurs. Andrew Ippolito: These are evolutionarily very important mutations The reason for that is.\nAndrew Ippolito: The proteins that result from these mutations we call truncation mutations the word truncate just means chop off right So if I have the number 9.99 and I asked you to round that to the nearest whole number, you would give me what.\nTaylor Campbell: 1010. Andrew Ippolito: If I told you to truncate that.\nAndrew Ippolito: would give me nine. Andrew Ippolito: Just chop off the decimal point that's what truncate means.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so truncation mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's a full length protein think of my odd because you've already seen that one in action it's got the helix loop helix this one binds the DNA this one binds to RNA polymerase or whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so we're going to take that and let's say that we introduce a point mutation right there.\nAndrew Ippolito: we add the STOP code on instead the consequence of that is going to give us a protein that doesn't have the other half to it anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so let's say that this part here binds to DNA and this part here bound to RNA polymerase so we we go from a transcription factor that has an activator to a transcription factor that has a suppressor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's the evolution works here's a gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say that there is an accidental duplication of that gene. Andrew Ippolito: for whatever reason there's a gene now there it is again.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're independent of each other and over evolutionary time this one gets one of those nonsense mutations.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this becomes a repress or protein this one used to be an activator now you have a refresher and an activator protein and they can compete with each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: And maybe they're under different controls of different promoters and enhancers you can start to see the snowball effect of all the different complexities that come out of that that's basically how over evolutionary time we come up with all these different proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's one of the ways. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so there I just that's me just cartooning this out there's my O D with him without his occupation to me.\nTaylor Campbell: that's just an example. Andrew Ippolito: yeah just an example.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that this did not necessarily happen. Andrew Ippolito: This isn't like this is why we get cancer in the muscle or something it's just just me, making it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here's another fun one, this is the fourth, this is one of the fortunes of evolution we're going to do a frame shift mutation we're going to add a brand new single nucleotide in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what that's going to do is force us to read in a completely different reading frame. Andrew Ippolito: We now have an entirely new completely unpredictable set of code ons that give rise to a completely new protein that we have absolutely no idea what it does.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why there's three steps go down, because the chances that these brand new unknown code ons make a protein the chance of it just stop somewhere there's a three out of 64% chance which is better than one.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So silent miss sense conservative radical nonsense frame shift.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's it those are those are the types."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Loss of Function and Gain of Function Mutations","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the effects of mutations on gene regulation and protein function.

Andrew Ippolito: Sometimes will change the function of a protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sometimes will change how a gene itself is regulated so what we're doing here when we say effects of mutations we're not talking about just the point mutations in the open reading frame we're talking generally mutations can lead to changes and protein function.\nAndrew Ippolito: mutations can lead to changes in gene regulation imagine mutating the top top box to be ta ta ta now tv's not binding to it anymore you've just said that gene off.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so mutations that affect gene regulation can be classified just two simple ways, there are gain a function and loss of function mutations, but I just gave you as a loss of function.\nAndrew Ippolito: A loss of function mutation is what we generally associated with tumor suppressors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of the rb protein again. Andrew Ippolito: If we lose the function of rb genes are now all when they shouldn't be glad alexa.\nAlexa Deprisco: So, are you saying that the loss of function mutation is directly tied to gene regulation or the thing.\nAlexa Deprisco: What whole thing I guess like gene regulation and protein function, are a result of loss of function, or just.\nAndrew Ippolito: All oh. Andrew Ippolito: So, think of it this way, if I have a loss of function mutation where the gene is now in activated I don't have a protein to change the function of it's not even there anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So for the retinoblastoma protein that classic tumor suppressor we learned about earlier, the mutation that people have when they get our friend noblesse doma is they don't have a miss folded protein or a broken protein they don't have it it's gone.\nAndrew Ippolito: When they look at those cells that proteins just not present when they trace it back to the gene it looks like the reason why it's not present is because the genes mean to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Its regulatory. Andrew Ippolito: functions are no longer working.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the opposite is again a function mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Imagine a mutation that turns the gene on instead of off. Andrew Ippolito: And those are associated with are called proto Wonka genes.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the protocol oncogene is the wild type version, the mutated version is called just the opposite.\nAndrew Ippolito: aka genes are genes that would turn the cell on right turn the cell cycle on.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And I were at one o'clock here so i'm just gonna bleed into the you if you gotta go you gotta go, I just want to finish this up.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So So can I delete that.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: germline mutations.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I said germ cell mutation on the slide, but we can also think of. Andrew Ippolito: mutations and the germline, these are the ones that affect eggs and sperm, these are the evolution of the important ones, these are the ones that get passed on."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 17 (Part 2) - Gene Regulation","link":"https://youtu.be/vMqe3Z44je4?si=X9D49hmFE_ojfATE","chunkTitle":"Causes of Mutations and DNA Damage","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the causes of mutations, including DNA replication errors, radiation, and chemical agents.

Andrew Ippolito: mutations and the germline, these are the ones that affect eggs and sperm, these are the evolution of the important ones, these are the ones that get passed on.\nAndrew Ippolito: As opposed to what are called somatic cell mutations all the other cells in your body.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those are the ones that lead to cancer. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when your somatic cells are mutated you don't pass those jeans though you don't pass those implications on to your children.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the other thing you can associate with mutations is this is one of the things that causes cells to age and organisms teach is, as we accumulate mutations in the course of our lifetime night we can suffer aging effects.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Great so this this slide here i'm not going to spend much time here, but this, this is, you can now understand sickle cell anemia down to the mechanism of action and the source of it all, there is a single point mutation that occurs in the beta Globe enjoying.\nAndrew Ippolito: The G G code on which normally stands for atomic acid, which is hydrophobic it's charged gag becomes Doug do you G stands for veiling.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is hydrophobic. Andrew Ippolito: And so, this little tiny amino acid right there within the hemoglobin beta chain go from being charged to neutral number methylation we talked about this earlier, the idea of DNA methylation is the same same thing we're taking it out of play and so.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you have a whole population of these mutated molecules of beta globe in.\nAndrew Ippolito: That area that little the little hotspot right there that doesn't like water anymore gets masked, and so what ends up happening is the proteins turn into these filaments you get this polymerization of hemoglobin.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what that does is it fills the red blood cell with filaments and that contorts the cell into this weird shape the sickle cell shape and that causes the red blood cells to have a dramatically lower lifespan.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it'll have the consequence of plugging up it'll a gluten eight it'll come up in capillary beds cause all sorts of problems, the benefit to having that mutation, though, is that cells that look like this malaria can't grow in.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if you get infected with malaria your chances of surviving malaria go up to about 95 99% as opposed to 5050 April.\nApril Neeld: Korea wants the definition of the frame chef mutation again. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, thank you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you satori do remember the idea of a frame shift itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if I change if I just get rid of this tea.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I start reading from the H, instead, and I look at three letter words, you see, I put the see over here is that it's now these three letters right so heck.\nAndrew Ippolito: outta. Andrew Ippolito: Tete. Andrew Ippolito: Her.\nVictoria Bloemker: Okay, so they all just shipped by like one. Victoria Bloemker: Exactly. Andrew Ippolito: Okay well if I add a single.\nAndrew Ippolito: nucleotide anywhere in there, everything past that is going to be shifted one coat on so I called the friendship mutation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I can do to to you can add to. Andrew Ippolito: But if you have three then you're just adding a new code on. Victoria Bloemker: It okay yeah for some reason I I kept thinking that it was like you're missing one you only have like two in like the code on sequence, and I was like that doesn't like seem right, but I was just.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean you can. Andrew Ippolito: You can also remove one, you can have a deletion of a single one. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah you can do one or the other, you can add or take away.\nVictoria Bloemker: All right, thank you. Andrew Ippolito: you're welcome.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, we already talked about this so imagine imagine meeting the start code on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now you got nothing there's no there's no start site, the rhizome has no idea what to do with that, and so you just broke the gym completely.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you went through all that trouble of capping and telling and exporting and is on the cytoplasm and then there's just nothing to read it's a dud.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or if you mutate, the top box now you can't even start transcription which is way more efficient.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but the point is, is that these are loss of function mutations. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, what causes mutations we've already talked about this, the idea is you have an insult your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries not that kind of insult.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, like UV damage. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and then what happens is is the DNA gets what's called a lesion to it it's broken if we don't repair it right and instead we fix it so that it doesn't say what it used to say that that's what we call the mutation because that's what's going to get passed on to the next, so okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this can happen during DNA replication. Andrew Ippolito: Pro carriers have much higher rates of mistake, making then eukaryotes do, but they do happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: radiation is really good at, causing mutations right energy from subatomic particles is absorbed by organic molecules and that absorption causes bonds to break and then new bonds form that are abnormal and if this happens in the DNA leaders lead to changes in the genetic code.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay UV light induces the formation of what are called pyramids permitting timers, in particular with 13 so what that is is in the DNA itself if you have to tease next to each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: They will end up forming a cobell and bond between the two of them instead of these two a's right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right remember no like pairs with T so here the normal DNA would look like this, this would be a and i'll be here would be TT what you'd be like does is it causes these two t's to link together covelli and that caused them to bulge out a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you go out in the sun that's what's happening in your skin and then we have repair mechanisms for this okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, cigarette smoke has 4000 different chemical agents and over 60 of those have been characterized as carcinogens, and on top of that there's carbon monoxide there's tar there's arsenic there's lead.\nAndrew Ippolito: And all sorts of really, really nasty stuff and cigarette smoke, and on top of that nicotine itself has been found to inhibit apoptosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the cell doesn't die when it wants to. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so if you smoke cigarettes quit it easier said than done, I know.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have to worry about the types of DNA damage i'm not gonna hold you responsible for these so you can read through these on your own if you're interested in this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: But basically losing the period base itself so deep urination calculation is when you add a methyl group to something.\nAndrew Ippolito: or really yeah to one or more carbons to it that's the generic concepts right so i'd be I just want us methylation if I add to this escalation a subtle ation etc will not assimilation, these are just to add your corporate chains okay that's calculation and we have to get rid of.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is just a good summary of all the different kinds of problems, you can have in DNA okay so there's mics and Nick is when you have a single break in a single strand that's a Nick.\nAndrew Ippolito: As opposed to what's called a dsp a double strand break when both strands are broken, they just take a pair of scissors to the DNA that's the most dangerous it said that a single break in the DNA like that can cause the cell to kill itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: A single double strand break and cause apoptosis in some cells. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, that's all i'll say about that.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, just understand the difference between chromosomal mutations and gene mutations.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so think of a carrier type you can't see appoint mentation and the carrier.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And we're going to end on this very disturbing picture here, this is the carrier type of a nuclear test veteran somebody who, after they were exposed to severe amounts of gamma radiation from nuclear bombs blowing up and the Nevada desert actually or the Bikini atoll.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then they went on to have kids. Andrew Ippolito: And then, they also went on to get cancer and you look at their genome and you see it looks like another species all together.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you look at that the chromosome five what's going on there chromosome five has chunks of chromosome 16 mixed with it, I don't know chromosome 16th got like this third piece here.\nAndrew Ippolito: crumbling is who God is just this whole thing is a mess, you see chromosome looks a little melted here chromosomes nine is missing, this entire chunk but it looks like there's a part of it up here right so but yeah this person's alive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this is really. Andrew Ippolito: A testament.\nAndrew Ippolito: To how resilient life can be. Andrew Ippolito: The fact that you can shuffle the entire chromosome deck and still come out and not die.\nAndrew Ippolito: and have kids so this called into question, but the kids were like.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this was published in 2007 and, to this day, I have never found a single incident report of anything I can't find anything for a follow up for this mystery.\nAndrew Ippolito: So my guess is the military families off after getting sued and probably made them sign non disclosure agreements and not complain anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah I. Alexa Deprisco: wasn't like I think it's a town in America, it was people who are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like us, Australia, I think, is it. Alexa Deprisco: was like one, I want to say it was like a result of the Holocaust, but, like every kid in this town was like assign these twin.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah oh yeah well in any area of the world where there was a severe nuclear. Andrew Ippolito: I mean Chernobyl, I have a student I think in this class whose parents grew up near Chernobyl and they're both dealing with leukemias.\nAndrew Ippolito: and breast cancers yeah it's it's terrible I mean. Andrew Ippolito: we're all breathing in radioactive fallout still from the 50s it's still in our air just just little bits and there's there are these hypotheses that suggest a little tiny bit of radiation is a good thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because what that does well think about it, if you're just a little damaged your repair mechanisms are going to be all turned on.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so they're cleaning things. Andrew Ippolito: Whereas if you're not damaged those genes are off So the idea is just a little chronic level of stress keeps the body healthy it's like exercise right exercise keeps the body tight and healthy.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if we just sit all day that's bad, but if we do too much exercise that's bad too right, so there and I haven't done any of the follow up reading on this lately but.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the underlying idea is just just little bits of doses of radiation in low levels, I mean you go outside in the sun right you get a little bit of it there, so maybe not UV but um.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: So we're Okay, we don't have to worry about like the stuff we blow up in the desert in the 1950s anymore, the the Fukushima power plan Japan worries me a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: That that story was very much of a nightmare water was going on, you know, the idea that they're releasing all this water into the the ocean, but it's being diluted by.\nAndrew Ippolito: billion folds so that's I mean when you work with radiation on lab report down the sink, because the dilution rates, make it completely harmless you're talking about parts per billion parts per trillion at that point.\nyeah. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's that so you started this class, this is how you might have seen DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now you can kind of see things in there you start to read the matrix and you're taught how box, you can give me the compliment strand, you can look for the start sites right."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Biotech and Genomics","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the topic of biotech and genomics, highlighting its importance in improving the quality and length of life.

Andrew Ippolito: Anyway, i'll find it later.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we're just two minutes, and we have ads in the House do this time of the year anyway all right, where was I are the only two goals of science, a publicly funded science in America it's increasing the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Quality of our life and the length of it so most things come from that perspective.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first thing we're going to learn about is how we sequence DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: molecules how we get two b's and c's the Jews and there was this guy named Fred singer singer he there, he is on the right there he holds one of the most prestigious place on sciences, being one of the only people to win the Nobel Prize twice in the same field.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he wanted in 19 all right hold on I say hey guys, please be quiet.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm trying to teach.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay i'm okay. Andrew Ippolito: So singer won the Nobel Prize in 1958 for the structure of insulin he's the one that figured out the shape of insulin using X Ray crystallography.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: He he'd rather than like most researchers at this point the rest on their laurels and they enjoy you know talking tours and writing books, he just got right back into the lab and could work and.\nAndrew Ippolito: Eventually, he developed this ingenious method for sequencing DNA we call it the we still use it today, even though it was developed in the 80s with there are some labs that in little pockets they're still use for this technique it's laborious.\nAndrew Ippolito: My lab did it I didn't actually have to do it, thank God, but I watched people do it and I learned from them on how to interpret it all so.\nAndrew Ippolito: He developed in 1980 and at that point we were basically able to unlock genomics starting to think of the idea of sequencing entire genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, well outside of our bounds, I mean with his method you could sequence a few thousand sequences at a time, you know when we learned that our DNA had.\nAndrew Ippolito: 3.2 billion base pairs if you were trying to if you were going to sequence the human genome, with his method, it would have taken you literally centuries of work.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, once he developed this process a whole nother set of researchers start developing even better, faster stronger techniques and today we're on what we call I think we're on the third generation of sequencing technology.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're not there yet, in terms of being able to draw your blood and put it in a little machine, the size of about oh I don't know Lou USB stick.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'm plugging into the computer and put the drop of blood in there and then beep boop bop you got your genes. Andrew Ippolito: we're almost there, though, where within your professional career, it will happen within the next five to 25 years I can't give you a better prediction that maybe somebody else can but personalized sequencing of genomic information is going to change everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what i'm going to do is walk you through the singer method, the classic way of learning this stuff and what What it does is it gives us a."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Sanger Sequencing Method","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the Sanger sequencing method, which was developed by Fred Sanger.

Andrew Ippolito: Green alright so we've got a Roy G going on here So here we got de de oxy ribonucleic ATP that's a building block for DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah dx Arriva try Simon Dean triphosphate. Andrew Ippolito: The oxy cytosine triphosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: The oxy go on a Dean phosphate right So those are the three building blocks for DNA so DNA polymerase will take one of those and build the you know the railroad out of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right we're still we're still on the same page everybody's still here, making sense Okay, so if you think about it, when I add all that to the reaction there's gonna be a whole population of all those in there there's like 1000 molecules of each 1 million molecules of each one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what's going to happen is hear me. Andrew Ippolito: Right there's a nucleotide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now that color and H2 listening right so there's a bunch of a is and there's a bunch of teas and there's a bunch of CEOs and there's a bunch of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you can imagine that whatever see let's listen mentor sequence here let's say their sequence.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has 1-234-567-8910 1112 12 sequence here so let's say there's it starts with a and then there's an A in these places Okay, a.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then there's a tea here there's two here, maybe it ends and tea and then there's a see here and here and there's a g.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here, and here right so that that's the actual secret now we don't know what it is right we're just pretending we don't know what it is that's that's the sequence you want a sequence so really what we know about that sequence right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is that we know nothing. Andrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: 12 letters of mystery.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I want you to imagine we take a billion copies of that mysterious DNA and we put that in the testing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Along with the plum race and like isn't all that. Andrew Ippolito: Now if if we just let things go what would we do we just make a whole bunch of it right, so you can imagine we just make a whole bunch.\nAndrew Ippolito: of DNA that's all the same length. Andrew Ippolito: that's boring right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well let's say we did that we had this test to filled with this DNA right. Andrew Ippolito: As a control so we're going to run a gel now and I teach you about gel electro freezes you know i'm going to the simplest gel possible here's here's a gel with one well you guys did enough of this and.\nEric Miller: lobster right. Andrew Ippolito: raise your hand, if you remember a little bit of this from laughter okay good good good good so right, so we add our sample here at the top.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can imagine 3D there's there's a it's like a chain link fence that's made out of rubbery stuff right it's a three dimensional matrix.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the really heavy stuff is going to take a long time to get through, how is it getting pulled, by the way, there's an electric charge remember DNA is negative right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we're going to put a positive charge down here right we're gonna have a negative to a positive. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to be in a solution when I turn on the voltage gradient we're going to literally pull the DNA like a magnet through this matrix and so because we have just one molecule one size of DNA here it's going to run somewhere let's see right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's boring right, so I want you to understand that we have this gel thing going on right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now let's say. Andrew Ippolito: Now let's say we're gonna take for test tubes one for a TC angie's right so we're gonna for testing testing one and i'll just copy this easier to.\nAndrew Ippolito: stylists here there we go 234 alright so each of these trips, we got four with a for reaction oops for reaction tubes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, before we actually tubes here. Andrew Ippolito: And here's what we're gonna do to each one of these tubes.\nAndrew Ippolito: To each one of these tubes.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to add all that stuff right we're going to add.\nAndrew Ippolito: The a's and t's and c's and geez to each tube so like if you're in the lab you would boringly add a little bit of each one of the tubes bottom okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now to the first tube here we're going to call this the a tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna sneak in a little molecule on there we're going to add a little bit of a special version of ATP we're going to call it don't use a slightly different color here.\nAndrew Ippolito: di di oxy ATP. Andrew Ippolito: And what died, the RCA ATP is is just like normal D oxy ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Except. Andrew Ippolito: That three prime carbon no longer has the hydroxyl functional group.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the functional consequence of that.\nMichael Caselli: Has imagined that nucleotide was. Andrew Ippolito: integrated into a strand of. Michael Caselli: DNA will go Michael.\nMichael Caselli: Well it's not as polar anymore right. Andrew Ippolito: it's that one remember that that's where we add the new nucleotide as we're building a chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what do we do. Andrew Ippolito: Can we add another nucleotide to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes or no. Andrew Ippolito: No that's the secret that's what makes this so amazing that's what this was Sanders genius he basically invented a chain terminator right so here's what's going to happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's a secret to sanger sequencing.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm going to add some of that to this tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want us to think now here let's go back up here I mean grab this original sequence here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to imagine now in that test tube with 1000 molecules and it has the a's and t's and c's and g's and it also has an a small fraction of what you can think of is broken a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so the DNA polymerase is going to take this molecule here. Andrew Ippolito: The DNA polymerase is going to start on a template and a season, a there so it's going to put a tea.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: And then it sees a tea and so it's going to grab from the soup around the reaction and a.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is the important part is either going to grab a good day or a bad now, we only put a little bad, and so the chances are it's going to pick a good day.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the next letter is in a so we're gonna put a tea right all i'm doing is i'm reading along this compliment i'm making the compliments or tea at and then see, is it G G is a C, and here we go, we have a to double T here now let's say we get unlucky and we picked a bad day.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm done that molecule of DNA is done I can't make it anymore I can't add something here, because this is just an H it's not an O h.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but in that too there's another reaction going on at the same time that I managed to get the unlucky miss here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And somewhere else in the tube it got lucky enough to get through.\nAndrew Ippolito: All these, but then it got unlucky enough to make this one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then the next one T T gc a goth or both of those and then I got a T here CG T and then a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, in other words, every possible combination is present in that too, because there's a bajillion copies of it and it's happening a bajillion times and so probability wise statistically speaking.\nAndrew Ippolito: If we have a billion molecules of everything we're going to see even populations of every single one of those pieces of DNA Okay, now we can't see this right so let's pretend we have that tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in that too we added a little bit of this stuff and, together with all the other stuff and then we take that sample and we run it on a gel.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would see maybe something like that. Andrew Ippolito: You still with me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what we do now is we do that exact same thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: But in the second test tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know if you guys can read that purple and black is kind of a tricky combination here, but I need more colors that's ttp died, the oxy ttp oops and I put on the wrong let's put it in the T to.\nAndrew Ippolito: put it in this one. Andrew Ippolito: Right, not in this one this isn't in these tubes it's just an et tube right so each tube is a combination of all the normal stuff plus a unique think of it as a poison pill.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so i'm just going to do one more letter to you, so you can see that i'm not going to do this we're all four of them, this was going to take too long, but let's just do the second one alright, so I was getting a little lag here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright So here we got our second to have this has all the normal stuff in at the DNA polymerase to lie gaze to DTP ttp CDP GDP and also a little bit of the the ttp dd ttp.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so now using our original strand here. Andrew Ippolito: As a reference point, let me bring this down a little bit closer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so the DNA polymerase is going to grab the first letters in a we're going to get lucky and CT or here i'll tell you why let's i'll do an order now, so you can really see this, so the first letter is a tea right and so we're done we just have one nucleotide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, the second one, so we got a that gives us a tea, and then the second one's a tea that gives us an A and the third one, is a tea so we'll get that fragment of DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and then we got so we got T a get through that third one, and then the next one, is a g.\nAndrew Ippolito: c see a tea there we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: The next one BT at gc at.\nAndrew Ippolito: g see. Andrew Ippolito: up there, it is T and that would be the last one.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: So it's not important what the other letters are what's important is how long each one of those pieces are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So let's just do these two here watch this now i'm gonna take all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm gonna move this over here right, so all. Andrew Ippolito: All this, we can agree all this, these fragments of DNA are in the same test tube floating around.\nAndrew Ippolito: right but let's let's put them in size order pretend we ran a gel now. Andrew Ippolito: Right, this would be first.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this would be second.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this would be third. Andrew Ippolito: And then, though, so we have GMC i'm not accounting for hearing so let's see what's the next longest one this one.\nAndrew Ippolito: So clearly there's something in the middle there Okay, and then maybe this one.\nthat's one. thing grab that whole thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, this is going to be tricky I think this one.\nwrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm leaving gaps, where the Jesus us would be So there you go right so now, if I did this with all four letters I would have basically right every single letter would be represented here, I would have a continuous chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: A continuous size right and each one of them would be different from the others by a single nucleotide.\nAndrew Ippolito: They get shorter and shorter so here's what we're going to do here's how the gel would be run. Andrew Ippolito: there's a well the T the sea and then g.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's say we ran a the tea in this, so you run the reactions that the reaction go for a while.\nAndrew Ippolito: Until you think they're done and, by the way, in real life, what we do. Andrew Ippolito: Is we have radio labeled di di oxy a tcg and other words there remember when we use did hershey and chase we use radioactivity to make new DNA and RNA with the viruses remember the whole experiment hershey and cheese Okay, so we do something like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: We make artificial radioactive DVD http http etc, so that when we run this gel we can then expose it to a piece of film.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's radioactive and so what this is, this is what we're gonna see well i'll tell you what let me i'll stick to the original sequence.\nAndrew Ippolito: So i'm going to do it oh come on. My cheat a little bit here do this.\nbring this over here. All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's how i'm going to look at it Okay, so this is all black and white right there's no color and the gel we were just looking at size fragment so i'm looking over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: whoa what just happened.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right my computer is just not keeping up with the speed on my hand moving around here all right i'll just settle for a second.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so i'm going to look over here oh come on what are you doing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why does it keep cubit rubber banding back to this place.\nAndrew Ippolito: To wait another second. Taylor Obert: At the computer is trying to tell you the way you organize the sequencing with a different color letters doesn't line up with the squares.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so i'm looking at this, maybe I dropped from the top here and I see you see the last letters of tea, so that tells me the longest one of these this biggest one here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a T, which means the one in the T ln here i'm going to have a band that's really big race so remember how gelato freezes works, the big steps at the top, the smallest stuff gets a sneak through fast.\nAndrew Ippolito: The second largest one is in a. Andrew Ippolito: So i'm just going to do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: there. Andrew Ippolito: So, in reality, I would have four reaction tubes.\nAndrew Ippolito: I would run this gel. Andrew Ippolito: I would expose it to a piece of film.\nAndrew Ippolito: I would develop the film. Andrew Ippolito: And this is what the film actually looks like here's a real version of the film.\nAndrew Ippolito: in real life, these gels are about. Andrew Ippolito: A foot and a half big.\nAndrew Ippolito: The cassette you put this gentleman has two big pieces of glass that you have to it's a whole big apparatus and it takes an entire data set it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: It takes an entire day so you're pouring your plate you're pouring the gels the day you're running the reactions and then, when you're doing your reactions you're running the job and then just take oh gosh six to eight hours to run.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you take the gel you have to put it in the machine and you have to basically press it up onto a piece of blotting paper, so that you can take a exposure of film to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: You take that blotting paper it's already you're doing all this and radioactivity so there's all radioactive. Andrew Ippolito: And then you put it in a special film cassette with a piece of X Ray film the steam stuff you would use in the hospital thick chest X rays.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you'd expose it to so you would actually take a Geiger counter and you would measure, the amount of radioactivity coming off.\nAndrew Ippolito: You use that number on the Geiger counter to do some math to say, I have to expose my film for between two and three hours.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you do under two hours you're not going to see anything if you do over three hours you're going to see a big black blob.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you have to expose it just right, and you have to go to the dark room and run through a machine, you have to learn how to use all that stuff to you have to get all the chemicals all of your hands to interesting very involved process so, then you get this job.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you read the job and so each lane here so you'll notice at the top, you see there's there's tracks of four at a time okay that's because there's a tcg, and so this one, Joe represents, I would say let's see you're fine maybe.\nAndrew Ippolito: A couple of thousand DNA sequences. Andrew Ippolito: And so notice how you can't really read you can't really read the top of it it's like smeared you see the smearing so generally, you have to chalk it up to I can't read any of this.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is all unreadable at the top, and then you get to a point to where these dark lines are whoever is jealous really wasn't real life, they drew those lines, like this is about where we're going to be able to start sequencing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then they just started looking that you scan across these four let's say they look at these four here, and you say Okay, this one, you see this one's a little higher and that happens, be a so you'd say a.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know ti si G a tcg and you would just keep reading it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you have your notebook and I actually saw the sign you're doing this in our lab I came in one day, and she had one of these pieces of film.\nAndrew Ippolito: And she was in a notebook just in a big pen so hard just write in your notebook a gta gct tg and i'm like Oh, what are you doing that looks like a nightmare.\nAndrew Ippolito: And she's like oh we're sequencing the plasma, to make sure that we got the mutation that we need it, I was like i'm glad you're doing that, and I mean this is terrible cool that's sanger sequencing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so it's capable of sequencing small fragments of DNA couple thousand basis."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Modern Sequencing Techniques","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the more modern techniques used for DNA sequencing, such as fluorescent markers and nanopore sequencing.

Andrew Ippolito: So back to the PowerPoint here that right there on the right that's the galaxy nucleotide best with a dd NTP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And if you read your you take, yet the text version of this, the video that explains this is great it really it's a great walkthrough.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK so. Andrew Ippolito: The more modern version of this your book also walks through you use a different fluorescent marker for each nucleotide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can run it through these little tiny capillary gels.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you can read each one of those light each one of those strands with a laser and the laser can tell you what color comes off of it and that lets you interpret the sequence.\nAndrew Ippolito: You start to run gels you start to run reactions. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the newest technology you don't have to make DNA, this is how the latest generations work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Take some kind of very thin wafer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Put a hole in the middle of it.

Andrew Ippolito: This is all attached to a computer and electrodes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's the ingenious part. Andrew Ippolito: As the DNA passes through that hole that poor they call it a poor as it passes through the poor.\nAndrew Ippolito: The different bases. Andrew Ippolito: impact the voltage gradient differently.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the computers program to be able to assign a value to those voltage letters like that's the rough and dirty of it, such that, as the DNA passes through it just in real time it's like.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like taking a piece of rope and just making it through a whole and as it's going through the whole the computers like oh at T GCC but it's just really, really quick you don't have to synthesize anything you just have you have to purify the DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that's the that's right now the most modern take on sequencing DNA and I think this technique is what's going to bring us into the.\nAndrew Ippolito: The future of individually sequencing your DNA your doctor's Office, your doctor is going to buy something that's about this big is like the size of a.\nAndrew Ippolito: candy bar kit kat bar maybe two or three kit kat bars thick and they'll have a USB plug and plug it into the computer and Hello drop your blood sample in there and then just wait.\nAndrew Ippolito: So pretty cool right so that's that's that's the end of our little mini short story on DNA sequencing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I will draw lines.

Andrew Ippolito: The concept of a vector is is the shuttle that will bring your copy of your DNA to where you need it to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the idea is you have your favorite gene let's call it that your favorite gene, I want to refer to why F G what gene is it doesn't matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your favorite one Okay, and sometimes will refer to your favorite protein which comes from that g.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right sometimes we're interested in jeans like if we were studying cancer mutations sometimes we're interested in protein products like insulin because we want people to take insulin for diabetes depends on the use case.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, maybe the genes and enzyme that breaks down organic polymers, and so we stick that gene into bacteria and now that bacteria can eat oil Okay, it depends on what we want to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: The vector is what gets us there so remember a gene at the end of the day, we're particularly a protein gene we got that open reading frame and the excellence and the promoter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we want to just take the reading frame right, especially with the human gene you can't take a human promoter as we now know and put it into bacteria that doesn't work.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we take the human open reading frame and we stick that reading frame in front of a lack promoter ah, now we can trick the bacteria into making human protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the vector has to be designed in a certain way, so there's lots of different kinds of vectors there's two common types of actors, there are plasmid vectors.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there are viral vectors.

Okay. Andrew Ippolito: A plasmid is a type of vector naturally positives are not vectors naturally plasmas are just extra genomic pieces of DNA we find in pro carriers.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they generally just contain a small number of genes and an origin of replication so that the bacteria can make more and more of it that's a key part of that the origin right if there's no origin of replication you can't make any more of it, if you remember how DNA replication works.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we talk about the insert that's the thing we're going to stick in a vector that's our favorite gene sequence it's always a DNA sequence.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to splice it in or we're going to cut the plasmid we're going to stick it in there and then, once we do that we call that new piece of DNA the vector that has the little insert in it, we call that recombinant DNA, because it has DNA from multiple origins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now the word recount with the phrase recombinant DNA doesn't necessarily mean this it just means any DNA sequencing or see a sequence of DNA that contains different sources.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so a natural example, this would be a virus that is recombined so, for example, take a pig and, in fact, that pig with a human."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Gene Cloning","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the process of gene cloning, which involves making multiple copies of a recombinant vector.

Alison Howard: of your question.\nyeah. Alison Howard: It is the backbone is eat some link is made up of the same thing, how does it know where to put the neck think what is.\nAndrew Ippolito: A great question so so think of the active site of the enzyme. Andrew Ippolito: Right think of think of the shape of the active site.\nAndrew Ippolito: can recognize so so think of G a ttc think of the fact that that even though the backbones all the same, those nucleic acids are all the the periods in the premiums are all different right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that specific sequence GA ttc of the guanine added new that anytime anytime mean cytosine the enzyme is shaped to fit exactly that series of nucleotides.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when it grabs that series of nucleotides it cuts it there, this special like think of it like a machine that has a little cutting area like a little laser cutter right in between the gma.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it reads this and it goes boom. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and because it's a palindrome poop it puts the next cut there, and so that results in what we call a pair sticky ends, in other words, this overhang the TT a at the end, there is free to base pair with something.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So here's a better way to see it here's let's say here's the vector here's here's a plasmid and I cut it with a car one alright, if I zoomed in on it would look like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's see here one strand. Andrew Ippolito: And let me see if I can do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let me make this a little longer here.\nAndrew Ippolito: That they do that no keep going like that there.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can kind of see that now here, this is the fast way to do what your fingers your fingers like this okay and go upstairs to take take one hand go upside down and then do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's a double stranded DNA and then we cut it and you can see right here and right here are the sticky of these can stick together, these are complimentary ta ATT.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but we break them apart, I put them all the way over here now I step back, I want you to imagine now, if I had a new piece of DNA, as long as the ends were the same, I can glue it right in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's what happened, the next slide here. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so the orange represents the vector the blue I want you to look carefully the blue there, she has to overhangs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, whatever that is that blue, this is our insert where did it come from don't worry about it there's 1000 ways we can get that with genomic DNA, it could be, we can artificially synthesize that it doesn't matter The point is, is that it has this pair of sticky.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what's more is these sticky ends the reason that sticky ended like that is because it was cut with a core one.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's one of the keys here, it has to be cut, with the same enzyme so we're going to now cut the vector here.\nAndrew Ippolito: When I pull it apart there's our sticky ends, so you can see now that's complimentary to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's complimentary to that. Andrew Ippolito: So we can literally.\nAndrew Ippolito: put them in there now now you're asking well how you doing that, so this is what you do you take a test tube that's got a billion copies of both of these things, and you hope for the best.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you have a way i'll show you where you take that population of molecules and you can select for the ones you want.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll show you how that works, but right now here's a concept we're going to put these together sticky hands and now of course right, we have all these breaks on the DNA right Those are all 523 prime breaks.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't, we need to glue those together well guess, who comes in, to do that, like our old friend DNA like his dad just drop a him to the test tube and again we hope for the best and he seals, the deal.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now we have a piece of recombinant DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so any questions up to this point, this this needs to be ABC level stuff because if this doesn't make sense everything's going to fall apart for you, so this is where you're going to ask me simple questions now."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Expression Vector","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the pUC18 expression vector and explains its features, including the ampicillin resistance gene and the lacZ gene.

Taylor Obert: Good dealer so the ends hang off those are sticky ends.\nTaylor Obert: Not ones that are. Andrew Ippolito: No, so all of these, we would call sticky. Andrew Ippolito: hands, what makes them sticky is that there's a single strand jutting into space Okay, and we can distinguish them by.\nAndrew Ippolito: In a more complicated class I would teach you I think your book gives you this some restriction enzymes, this is just evolution and there's no reason for this, but some restriction enzymes will cut.\nAndrew Ippolito: In that staggered way with the palindrome you get the sticky answering that right that results in.\nAndrew Ippolito: The sticky ends right there are other restriction enzymes that when they cut they cut in the same place.\nAndrew Ippolito: They cut across the double strand, and so you get what are called blunt ends where they're the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: see a blunt ends versus sticky blunt ends are useless, for us, and so it turns out, when we have to actually do this in the lab let's say that the only.\nAndrew Ippolito: restriction as i'm that we can use for this particular sequence of DNA we care about is a blend we would then have to further process that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's a special part of DNA called the clan now fragment you don't have to know that for the test, but this is just really cool it's called the canal fragment it's a little piece of DNA polymerase and what it does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is it eats away. Andrew Ippolito: And it gives us sticky hands.\nAndrew Ippolito: Naturally, there are times in the cells life when it has these blunt ends let's say when it's doing DNA repair.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have you know some kind of damage to the DNA, we learned about last time, and we have this double strand break.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you want to put those back together again you have to you have to basically play with a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if you've ever had a damaged at home let's see somebody accidentally punched a hole in the wall or drop something into the wall, you have this big damage on the wall.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, have you ever had to repair something like that you take a razor blade you cut out on neat Square and you get rid of all the garbage right, so you take something that's frayed and damaged and you trim it a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you patch it that's what we do with DNA to we trim it a little bit we clean it up a little bit, and then we just put some filler in there it's not as good as the original but it's gonna you know it'll still keep the rain out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay okay so sticky more questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: i'm not going to show you, and this is an actual vector we use in the lab okay this vector does all the things that your book tells you in the theoretical so your book gives you all this information about the double selection and all that this is the actual one that I use this.\nAndrew Ippolito: is called paki team Puck the Puck vector This is called an expression vector we call it an expression vector because it's controlled by the lack promoter and let's just grow things and bacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: So if you have a protein like so I had a protein, I wanted to grow up in in bacteria and then purify it to do experiments with I stuck the gene for that protein in this plasmid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so Puck stands for the lowercase P, is for plasmid the uc is because it was discovered and define it was created at the university California and I was 18th one they did.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I think your book gives you Puck 19 as an example and it's exactly 2686 space peers.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's one of the nice things about working with DNA is it's very digital there's very specific numbers as but proteins are like vinyl records and DNA is like MP3 there's the digital world and the analog world DNA nucleic acid Rosemary digital and the protein bars are a analog.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's the origin of replication. Andrew Ippolito: All right, right that's got to be there because when we stick this in bacteria and grow them, we need them to make many copies of this, so this gives us the ability to clone it so this.\nAndrew Ippolito: This here that's the ampicillin resistance gee it's under constitutive expression control from the amp our promoter it's always on and we never wanted to turn off.\nAndrew Ippolito: The gene amp are gives us an enzyme that allows the cell to survive in the presence of this antibiotics ampicillin we abbreviate that amp.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so amp in the presence of amp bacteria don't grow, they don't die, but they don't grow if they have the amp our gene in a plasmid inside them, they can grow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, with the protein product of this gene does is it gets exercise those to get spit out in the solution around it and then it's a it breaks down ampicillin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.

Andrew Ippolito: Why would we need this here, well, we want to make sure.\nAndrew Ippolito: That one we're working with the bacteria were using and we stick this plasma into them, we need to make sure that it's actually there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So I want you to think of it this way ready, let me use a whiteboard for this let's start building this concept out where's my whiteboard.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's a petri dish. Andrew Ippolito: This is just a normal petri dish doesn't have anything special in it, if I poured bacteria in there, I played it on the plate I let it going to beat for 37 degrees overnight come in the next day it's gonna be covered in bacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if I add ampicillin to it, and I do the same thing I come in the next day nothing's going on, because I don't you know I just if I just added some generic E coli to it's not gonna grow that'd be a nice clean plate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right now, if I had a bacteria here let's see, this is a bacterial so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so let's see all that a government now so if I just add this bacterium to this ampicillin plays not going to grow, because he can't because there's no resistance stamp isn't but if I take my expression vector that has that amp our gene in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: The Amazon resistant seen in it now i'm going to see.\nAndrew Ippolito: My bacteria grow in the presence of ampicillin. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that tells me.\nAndrew Ippolito: That I have these you know these uh.\nAndrew Ippolito: These little growth these colonies those colonies have my have bacteria in them.\nAndrew Ippolito: But I should say this i'm sorry i'm getting tired these colonies have bacteria made from those with the plasma.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So let's just let's keep it simple right now, just think about this like if we were in lab if I was teaching you a basic molecular techniques.\nAndrew Ippolito: class, we would do this, we would just take puc 18 alone just generic paki teen with that emphasis on resistance and we would do a practice transformation so that's what we do, we take a test tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this test tube would have within it, so he call I write a whole bunch of it billions of living cells will be color.\nAndrew Ippolito: And these are specially call I, these are a color we beat up a little first. Andrew Ippolito: We beat them up a little bit we soften them up, but we did was we made their membranes a little permeable we call these competence cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Competent, in other words, there are more competent to be transformed we're gonna they're they're more likely to absorb within them.\nAndrew Ippolito: DNA from their environment, remember Fred Griffith is experiment with the MICE remember the idea of transformation okay in vitro transformation that's what we're doing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it turns out transformation is very rare in nature, it doesn't happen too often one in a million, so what we've learned is, we can take bacteria and make them a lot more likely to transform and so there's a whole process there to make competent vector or you can buy them.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're super fragile think of them like. Andrew Ippolito: Slightly broken pieces of porcelain right you're transferring them pipettes you have to be super gentle with these things are just going to start lights it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we have competent back here and then we're going to add a bunch of this Puck we're going to add the plasma here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we're going to just we're going to do a protocol, where we incubate them in certain ways to make them basically suck up that that Puck.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the problem is not the problem, but what's but the reality is is most of the bacteria won't be transformed, so if we were able to in our minds i'd go inside of that test tube we would see two kinds of bacteria, we would see bacteria that successfully brought the positive in.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they would be in the minority. Andrew Ippolito: And there will be a whole bunch of bacteria that didn't get it that'd be the more common.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what we're gonna do is we're going to have a little test to appear with a billions of bacteria and we're going to complete them after we incubate them, and so we say after our transformation reaction we're going to put them on to.\nAndrew Ippolito: An employee. Andrew Ippolito: And then we're gonna put him in the incubator and we're gonna let them grow overnight at 37 degrees and hope for the best and we come in the next day, and we look at it, and if we did something wrong like we pipe edit them to violently there's going to be nothing growing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you're going to start your experiment all over again and you're going to do that for three or four weeks, probably because you stink at this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your first year Grad student, you have what's called the system touch everything you will King midas right anything King midas touch turns to gold.\nAndrew Ippolito: really good people who work in lab they say they have golden hands everything they touch turns to gold they're really good lead the system touches the opposite of that everything you touch turns to shit.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So, remember that remember the question we went over today, it was like a researcher becomes proficient in an ability to swap pieces of D, but the whole becoming proficient thing that's the whole you tried it 1000 times until you finally figured out how to do it.\nAndrew Ippolito: You become a really important person in the lab because you know how to do something like this okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's see you got good at this, you have to do the control anyway, you pour it in there you go overnight, and now the next day you come in and let's say there's three colonies, the think about that for a second there were a billion cells in there you've got three.\nAndrew Ippolito: The 300 billion chances happened basically statistically speaking that's how rare, this is you got three columns.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, each one of those colonies came from one cell that then went through binary vision, again and again and again every 20 minutes and you got to the point where you can see it.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called the corner selection carnal expansion Okay, and because it's growing the President ampicillin you know now that those bacteria have your vector.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what you can do is take a little loop, and you can scoop it up, and you can go over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: To 500 milliliters of broth media that has ampicillin in it, you have to keep the ampicillin in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And just put a tiny little drop of bacteria in there, put it in a shaker go overnight again, and the next day you come in so you're D3 now you have 500 milliliters of cloudy bacteria, you have literally trillions of cells that all have your positive.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you forget to add the ampicillin here. Andrew Ippolito: You come in the next day, and you also see a bit cloudy thing and then you go through another two days and purifying the DNA, only to find that it's not there anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why, because if you don't put the ampicillin there the bacteria don't care how to grow and they don't care about your plasma they don't need it anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so slightly or mutations happen, eventually, they just don't keep it, and so the bacteria that don't have the plasma, they can grow a lot faster and better because they don't have to deal with this plasmid and so you have to meet basically maintain a constant selective pressure."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Color Assay","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the use of X-Gal as a color assay to detect the presence of the lacZ gene.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now let's think about a plasma that has her inserted. Andrew Ippolito: that's where things start to get interesting so going back to the PowerPoint here, you see this part here and so we've talked about the origin we've talked about the bar.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now it's talking about this mess over here that's the legs EG you already learned that in the black op RON what's the likes eating do again what protein does that produce.\nMichael Caselli: collects the site is. Good. Andrew Ippolito: beta galactic side, as we call it beta gamma something people got bigger whatever that ends on does white it cuts lactose in half right normally so will we do is, we have an artificial version of lactose is called ex-co.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, instead of glucose and galactose it's this other thing X and collectives still die sacra X go.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call X Gal a non metal realizable. Andrew Ippolito: analog of lactose, in other words to sell a treat it like lactose, but it can break it down for energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now normally X Gal is a white powder.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the presence of beta glass the site is. Andrew Ippolito: The enzyme will break it down and the byproduct of that the chemical will look blue it changes color.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are the kinds of tools we use. Andrew Ippolito: to let us, we can take advantage of this system, the idea of taking a clear, you know white color and turning a blue only in the President, the enzyme that means if it turns blue, we have the enzyme right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we can be haha we are the enzyme. Andrew Ippolito: So, going back to our original experiment here.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I added X Gal to this plate.\nAndrew Ippolito: What color were those colonies be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think about that for a second that but i'm going to give you a minute chew on that okay so ready We took our paki paki teen had two markers in it, it had the amp resistance gene and it had the lexi gene in there, we added it to so we transformed ourselves, we stuck him in a petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that Peter just contains both ampicillin the selectable marker one and X gauss let's have a marker to what color in our control are those colonies white or blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: This would be a good test question.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay logic your way through this, why would something be blue in this environment, what makes it blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're here.

Alison Howard: Ever question. Andrew Ippolito: yeah got. Alison Howard: just want to make sure i'm understanding streets, it does it turn blue because the X cow gets broken down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, and why does the X gotta get broken down. Alison Howard: Because they metabolize it. Andrew Ippolito: What metabolizes it.\nHe. Alison Howard: they're not that the bacterial cells. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, what, how is it metabolizes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: there's that's The key to this. Where Am I reading this here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This gene. Andrew Ippolito: produces the protein beta go.\nAndrew Ippolito: beta galley enzyme breaks down X Gal that's white and turns it blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so if we see a blue colony that tells us, we have a bacterium that has the pokey team in there it's producing beta gullah societies it's breaking down X Gal from white to blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in other words, we have a functional lack CG. Andrew Ippolito: OK, and now we're gonna break it ready, I want you to look over here so okay so first of all right, we had the last promoter and locked operator, they are that's why this is called an expression vector that gives us the power to express what's ever downstream from that promoter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay immediately so in the beginning of the lack CG right here artificially scientists have put this thing in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called the mcs it's called a multiple cloning site and all it is, is a series of palindromic sequences palindromic sequences that represent the cut sites for just a small library of enzymes and these are those enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: The memorize this but there's ECHO r1 and there's others there's hank to him three the quiet one one sack one SMA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and all these words are funny to say out loud my very first slide but here's a very quick fun story my very first lab meaning ever I was handed a PowerPoint deck that had to give publicly to the lab and within it, it was a.\nAndrew Ippolito: was a cloning protocol step one do this step two, and so one of the steps at the very top of the slide and ball that said.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I had to say, we cut it with restriction enzyme. Andrew Ippolito: buck one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Guy all the giggles and I giggle to and that's the name of the enzyme as well Fuck one.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah. Andrew Ippolito: So it's one of those enzymes has a different word that it does right and so when we're dealing with human genes or you know, whatever gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't pick those sequences Nature did so, what we have to do is read that sequence, and hope that we can find a cut site somewhere in the five prime end of the gene and the three primary thing, so we can cut it out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's a whole tactic itself right that's why we have this mcs so it gives the researcher more a higher chance of finding a good concert.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now let's say that you're dealing with a gene that has none of those cuts sites in it, well then you're not using puppy team you're using 22 that has a whole separate set of mcs sequences.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's a lot of planning that goes into this stuff and in fact the first few weeks of a project, when you first start in the lab is your planning what's called your cloning strategy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your cloning strategy involves picking out the right enzymes in the right sequence is and what you're going to do with it all you have to map out the battle before you do it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, right here is where that mcs is now I want you to think about this, if I cut the plasma right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Look at what that does to the lack CG lakota dose of the product, the the genomic speed ago it breaks it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so when I cut the legs aging open. Andrew Ippolito: I break it if I put it back together again then it's fine again right so ready remember this idea we're going to take the vector.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to think now here's the multiple cloning site and we're gonna cut it with ECHO r1 once that that opens it up right we get the sticky ends here in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys with me Okay, so now imagine we have a test tube filled with a billion copies of puppy team and we sprinkle in some ECHO r1 and we incubate it for 15 minutes and now all of those vectors are split open they're all cut right and they're all we're going around in a test tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: What i'm going to do, then, is i'm going to add to that test tube a billion copies of my insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: Previously, or it was a previously, I have some help come up with this insert and then it also has the same sticky animals there's a billion copies of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then I just incubate them and I cross my fingers and I hope I did everything right and so there's only two champ there's only two outcomes here.\nAndrew Ippolito: The most common outcome which we don't want is that the vector so here's look at my hands for a second here is the vector we opened it now these these are complimentary to each other right so it's just going to do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: is going to close again. Andrew Ippolito: it's so broken right, we still need like ease, but so we call this the empty vector.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't want this, but that happens, most of the time and then rarely.\nAndrew Ippolito: The vector will stick co violently with the insert will call this vector plus insert, and this is what we want.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, but we can't see any of this, this is just invisible on the test tube happening billions of times.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, once we give it some time and we hope for the best we then add some ligation there and what the luggage does is it makes all this permanent right it glues this together.\nAndrew Ippolito: They glues these together, and now we have these permanent, these are very common and pieces of DNA now but, rather, this one is anyway, this one's just it's old paki teen so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So now, the question is how do I distinguish those right, so I take this test tube that has this whole population of vectors and inserts or empty vectors in it, and then I do a transformation reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's go back to the PowerPoint now, so we do this whole transformation reaction now Okay, and I want you to think about what happens in that test tube drink transformation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so ready, we have this test tubes we use white. Andrew Ippolito: Have a test tube and in that test tube we have two populations of molecule we have our closed vector or empty vector and we have our vector plus our insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to use that here's another tube and this tube has a whole bunch of eco lion.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we are going to take our reaction tube and we're going to put a whole bunch in here, not all of it, but a lot of it and we're going to incubate it and we're going to go through this whole protocol for transformation.\nAndrew Ippolito: The incubator on ice for five minutes me heat shock it and we let to recover we do all stuff and then we played it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we played it on ampicillin. Andrew Ippolito: And also X go.\nAndrew Ippolito: We we overnight, I mean go 24 hours 37 degrees.\nAndrew Ippolito: We come in the next day and nothing's there oh that sucks, we have to do all again that's probably what's gonna happen, the first time you do it, and the second, maybe the third.\nAndrew Ippolito: You maybe come in one day and they're all there you see a bunch of colonies, but they're not white and that's because you actually grew up in an emphasis on paper forgot they had the scale.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you have to grow it again and, eventually, you get to the point where you're like okay this place has a good transformation in it it's got X gallon ampicillin the incubator didn't break down overnight.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here I am and I see a whole bunch. Andrew Ippolito: Of i'm Sorry, I see a whole bunch of blue colonies.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, which means what Mr blue colony represent.\nAlison Howard: X scam. Andrew Ippolito: Good which means, so what so remember. Alison Howard: The lacquer that it has a lack of different.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what what so which one of these is is does that represent a or B, that is it the empty vector or is it the vector plus answer.\nBe. Alison Howard: be the vector plus to insert. No.\nAndrew Ippolito: No here's why so this, this is the tricky part ready, so what you're going to get it now, this is what's going to make you understand everything when we add that insert in there, we have interrupted the lexi gene We broke it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So a bacterium that has this will make no functional.\nAndrew Ippolito: beta go. Andrew Ippolito: Without a functional beta Gal it's not breaking down X Gal to make it blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay hey the empty vector has beta gallon it. Andrew Ippolito: it's going to make blue so most of these colonies are going to be blue, whether you like it or not, you're gonna hopefully I mean you're already ahead if you see a bunch of blue that means everything else worked.\nAndrew Ippolito: What you're looking for the holy grail of this experiment is that magic white colony.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so let me draw this in a cleaner way let's look at it from a bird's eye view you're going to see a whole bunch of blue colonies those each one of those college represents a successfully transformed bacterium.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you might see one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Depending on the quality of the insert you gave it. Andrew Ippolito: Like if it was a product of another reaction like a PCR reaction, you might not see it, so you might have to plate let's see your reaction had a I don't know.\nAndrew Ippolito: A whole milliliter of bacteria, you might have to play seven or eight petri dishes and look through all seven of those and look for one of them it has one white because you're looking for the needle in the haystack.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so think about that transformation reaction for a second go back up here think about that transformation, we have here's a bacterium.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we want is for that bacterium to take up our plasmid that includes our insert that's our that's what we want Okay, but there's two other kinds of bacteria in there there's the bacterium that took up the empty vector.\nAndrew Ippolito: This okay so ready this one's going to grow in the presence of ampicillin right.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's going to grow okay in episode, because you got the vector and he's going to keep the X Gal white because he doesn't have better like sightings.\nAndrew Ippolito: This one is going to grow in the presence of ampicillin you're going to see a colony of him, but he's going to be able to functionally break down that beta go i'm sorry the X Gala he's gonna make a blue collar.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you're going to have the lazy bacterium that didn't feel like transforming at all and he's not going to grow at all.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't even see him that's why this plate only has maybe seven or eight colonies on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the President ampicillin only the bacteria that took up the plasmid are going to grow on it, and then the white ones, are the ones that absorbed the or rather were transformed by the plasma that had your fear Regina and search.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what you then do the very last step to all this is, you would take a sterile loop, you would very carefully physically grab that scoop it up put it into a huge flask and grow it in the presence of ampicillin.\nAndrew Ippolito: and the next day you come in and you would have a full leader, or whatever you want of bacteria, where every single one of those trillions of cells is producing your protein of interest or your gene of interest.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then from there sky's the limit, you can do 1000 different things. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, what I would do in lab, or so I did all this with having I wanted to make a protein product for pm, so it was a human protein that I was doing in vitro.\nAndrew Ippolito: Protein interaction assays, and so I would do all this, and I would come in the next day, and I would then pour all this into a centrifuge with pure.\nAndrew Ippolito: spin it all down get the bacteria itself and then we'll put it in a test tube and I would do all this stuff to purify the p amp l protein from it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Using antibodies, and all this fancy stuff it would take the whole process, from start to finish, would take.\nAndrew Ippolito: Two weeks. Andrew Ippolito: To go from here, you know here's your here's a little vial of your plasmid in here some bacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, from that point to here's a tube containing some artificially produced PL protein it's about two weeks.\nAndrew Ippolito: very laborious stuff. Andrew Ippolito: But. Andrew Ippolito: it's at the end of the day, it's kind of exciting because you're you know you're basically purifying the building blocks of life and then asking questions about them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay questions. Michael Caselli: I was just wondering seven like.\nMichael Caselli: How exactly is there a white bacterial cell in the presence with with.\nMichael Caselli: Like when when there shouldn't be exactly like why, why does it spawn. Michael Caselli: Like I was speaking to you says to like when we have the X Gal President, and then there would be all the blue factory of cells in the white one like, why does it exist.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why does the blue one exist. Michael Caselli: know the white one like the single like the loan white one. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, why does that one exist yeah Okay, so if you go all the way back to the reaction.\nMichael Caselli: here. Andrew Ippolito: The idea of step one is cut the insert. Andrew Ippolito: So we opened it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Step two is to incubate it i'm sorry i'm sorry I said insert let me i'm tired sorry, let me see us again we take our plasmid and we cut it with a restriction, as we open it up step one step two is we incubated with a whole bunch of our insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: At this point. Andrew Ippolito: Most of that vector is just going to close again.\nAndrew Ippolito: But some of it is going to have are inserted.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we have a me like eat it right, we got like so we have a test tube that contains both of those both of this, and this on the same population of molecule we're then going to take that mixture and we're going to add it to bacterial cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the bacterial cells are either not going to take it at all. Andrew Ippolito: they're going to take up one of the more common empty vectors or they're going to take up our vector plus the insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we then want to take that whole. Andrew Ippolito: Little tube of bacteria that are also part of his whole population mixed population or organ i've played all those in the President of both ampicillin and X go Okay, adding the emphasis on ensures that we can get rid of him we don't want him.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, adding the X Gal allows us to distinguish between the two survivors if it's a white colony that tells us it's a containing are our vector that's good if it's a blue colony we don't want that one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is what we mean by a selectable marker it allows us to indirectly determine the presence of our vector positives.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that helped me. Michael Caselli: yeah Thank you. Michael Caselli: you're welcome. Andrew Ippolito: All right, more questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so to summarize this you can say the goal of the first marker is at answering the question is my plasmid present.\nAndrew Ippolito: The secondary selectivity is is my recombinant plasmid present.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's two hurdles to get over is one is did my transformation work at all and to did my insertion work.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you need the two because neither one of the markers alone ampicillin alone or X Gal alone is not sufficient right if I just grew the bacteria nap to ceylan.\nAndrew Ippolito: I would just see bacteria right and there's a one in 1000 chance that the bacteria that I randomly pick from that has my answer it right, so an easier thing to do would be to add with the Expo if I did X Gal alone, I would just grow a whole bunch of bacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I wouldn't be able to distinguish my individual colonies. Andrew Ippolito: I would never find it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the idea, there is untransformed bacteria will grow much faster than transform bacteria, because they have less of a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of having the plasmid is kind of a drag right, you have to it's going to take you a little longer to grow, because you have all this extra stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so the untransformed bacteria is gonna be able to sprint, while the other guys being held down by you know there's 50 pound bag.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you need to hold back the sprinters and let the guy with the 50 pound bag get through it.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what the whole key of selection is okay, and so that's that's the basics of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Bio that's the basics of gene cloning. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now let's say that you wanted to encode a let's see you wanted to create a human gene product you wanted to create like insulin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and we have that pesky promise in terms of next ons bacteria have no idea what to do with those right, so we need a piece of DNA that doesn't have in transit.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so to do that. Andrew Ippolito: We purify from human cells, a bunch of messenger RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you do that remember the poly tales, or you can buy these beads that stick the poly.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you take a boatload of cells you'll blow mobilise and you get a license and you run them on these beads and the only thing that sticks to the beads like little magnets for RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you wash them away you wash the beads until the only thing that's left is the RNA and then you then you can treat them in a certain way that where the RNA falls off the beads and other and solution right, so you purify the Arctic, Mr.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the idea is the cell did all the dirty work for you all the electrons are being cut out all the splicing happened, you now have a splice mature transcript.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, the second thing you do. Andrew Ippolito: Is you take that RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you reverse. Andrew Ippolito: transcribe it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Reverse engineer it to DNA there's an enzyme called reverse. Andrew Ippolito: transcriptase.\nAndrew Ippolito: A major we find these retroviruses like HIV retrovirus genomes or RNA, and so what they do is the opposite of what we do day take RNA and they convert it into DNA and so we're going to take this tool reverse transcriptase RT.\nAndrew Ippolito: or we're going to take our messenger RNA and we're going to run or an RT reaction reverse transcriptase reaction, and so what we call a product of that is complimentary DNA see DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is totally artificial, this is all pure laboratory stuff we take the human Mr na for insulin and we converted into a small piece of DNA called see DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the key is when you see this, and this is only one to come from this is a very important thing when you see see DNA, I want you to think.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is messenger RNA that we have now this long term high quality stable molecule of coding for it right, we can do all sorts of stuff with this, there are things, called CD may libraries, a CD me library is an entire pile of petri dishes that have random.\nAndrew Ippolito: pieces of Mr ne that have been converted to CD throughout them these libraries are what allows us to have access to any.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mr na in the world that's expressed in whatever species, you have the library for so let's say you want to do some research on a particular gene in humans you wanted to work with a particular protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: You would take a CDMA library, he would find the plate that had the gene in it you're interested in, you would grow some of that up and you would purify some of that CD name, so you get the insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so now we have this insert. Andrew Ippolito: made from a piece of Mr na and that insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can then use in there, it is a vector plus insert the whole idea of the insert there, so what we can do, then, as we can put that into bacteria like we just walked through.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that bacteria, while now produce a human protein. Andrew Ippolito: Because there's no insurance anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: make sense okay good. Andrew Ippolito: So you can the rest of this stuff you can read through on your own.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay Okay, so this this picture here, this is for those of you who really like the visuals This is like the puppy team picture, but I want you to see this blue part here that's lexi.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this brown parts and multiple coding side so we're going to cut it here we're gonna open it up and then we're going to stick our vector in it and that's what this big.\nAndrew Ippolito: pink part is, and so you can see the remnants of the LACs EG and blue right the original black intact gene is now interrupted by the inserted Dean as well breaks it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, a cell that gets transformed with this vector this recombinant vector will no longer be able to produce a functional being a black societies won't be able to break down next Gal.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it will remain white.\nAndrew Ippolito: questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Almost done here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, this slide here just gives you a summary of what, so why what can we do with this technology well.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can take the gene of interest.\nAndrew Ippolito: make copies of the gene, and then we can do things like put those genes into plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's say that you just okay so here's a real world example let's say that we found this plant in Africa that was really resistant to everything it was resistant a fungus infection was resistant to being eaten by insects, it was resistant to all sorts of things, but it tasted terrible.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was like the worst it tasted like poop.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you take the gene from that plant. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, so you do some research and you realize oh there's a gene here, this is resistance gene so let's take this plant that tastes like poop and take its resistance gene and stick that resistance gene into strawberries.\nAndrew Ippolito: turns up the strawberry cheesecake poop know they're still strawberries. Andrew Ippolito: made he's great, but now they're resistant to all the same stuff that the other plan was resistant to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we just said hey I really like this part of you, but not the rest of you i'm just going to steal this one part i'm going to go put this over here in this dropper.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what we're doing genes for pest resistance.\nSophie Cloutier: question. Andrew Ippolito: yeah but. Sophie Cloutier: The gene inserted into the strawberries be recessive are dominant.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a great question, it would be. Andrew Ippolito: Dominant because. Andrew Ippolito: it's producing an enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is what makes it easy to grow right doesn't matter if they're hybrids or if there's an accidental mutation and it you'd have to be homozygous recessive which is rare right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, or let's say that we are interested in the protein product of the G.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so like there's human kinds of human growth factors that we can have the bacteria produce artificially and now we can treat people.\nAndrew Ippolito: who have diseases, for example, you have people with stunted growth because they don't produce the right growth hormones, so you give them the medicine for it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, or there's proteins that dissolve blood clots.\nAndrew Ippolito: My favorite, though, let me skip ahead of your my favorite. Andrew Ippolito: Where is he hold on i'm going to go all the way to the end of the.\nAndrew Ippolito: way i'm telling the story you guys today. areas.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the tomato tomato tomato.\nAndrew Ippolito: above the ground that makes tomatoes below the ground, it makes potatoes.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a nominal tomato it's a nominal potato it's just in the same plan you've just essentially effectively doubled your farming acreage.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can now take your one acre of land and make twice the amount of food.\nAndrew Ippolito: Simply because you can now just grow more useful things right, a tomato plant has roots a potato plant has roots potato plants don't have much interest on the surface, so all underground their tubers and tomatoes don't have much of interest going under the roots tomatoes or fruits.\nAndrew Ippolito: I thought they were vegetables now their fruits.\nMichael Caselli: I have a question about that tomato. Andrew Ippolito: yeah. Michael Caselli: Would it take like twice as long to to produce it.\nnope. Andrew Ippolito: So the tuber the all the potato is. Michael Caselli: Is.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a storage. Andrew Ippolito: specialization and what the tomato is it's a method for reproduction so in nature that tomato does this thing and the potato does that and then.\nAndrew Ippolito: No plant naturally evolved both of those things, and so we just made this hybrid called it's called so it's called a transgenic plan Okay, a transgenic organism is an organism that contains genes for different bases.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we have created pest resistant cotton pest resistant corn pest resistant potato we've produced soy beans that are resistant to certain herbicides.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we can make plants that have human proteins in them and then purify those.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: We have animals.\nAndrew Ippolito: That can produce human protein so imagine taking the insulin gene and putting it into goats or cows and now milking them and now they're making insulin and their milk and you can just purify the Internet from their milk and milk them as much as you want until they die.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right there's all sorts of things my favorite that I learned about this is back in the 90s.\nAndrew Ippolito: They took the genes from spiders that made silk the spider gene to spider associates, and they put them in goats.\nAndrew Ippolito: With the idea was they wanted to make spider cells from codes they call them goat spiders, the idea is terrifying.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it was just a normal goat that had the gene it turns out, the company and that tried this failed miserably because spiders.\nAndrew Ippolito: They don't just produce their threads in a way of like polymers they they have a whole complex apparatus that lets them we've their webs.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when the researchers were working with the transgenic version of the spider proteins, they were it was just this gloppy sticky stuff they couldn't do anything useful with it, I mentioned the company went bankrupt.\nAndrew Ippolito: was still fun story, though, you get a boat spiders into Google and learn about this. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so.\nAndrew Ippolito: This whole world of GMOs right that's the one of the things that people are really still concerned about little unless you don't really read about this in the news these days.\nAndrew Ippolito: The shorter the long is. Andrew Ippolito: I have the one."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"The Process of Gene Cloning","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of gene cloning using plasmids.

Good. Alison Howard: Exactly. Andrew Ippolito: And the blue color looks almost exactly like this color it literally looks like that color This is like the perfect.\nAndrew Ippolito: X Gal product color that that shade of blue you'd seen so you'll see that in the lab you'll do this experiment and sure enough you'd see blue colonies everywhere that's great that means you have your system up and running.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Alison Howard: Ever question. Andrew Ippolito: yeah got. Alison Howard: just want to make sure i'm understanding streets, it does it turn blue because the X cow gets broken down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, and why does the X gotta get broken down. Alison Howard: Because they metabolize it. Andrew Ippolito: What metabolizes it.\nHe. Alison Howard: they're not that the bacterial cells. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, what, how is it metabolizes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: there's that's The key to this. Where Am I reading this here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This gene. Andrew Ippolito: produces the protein beta go.\nAndrew Ippolito: beta galley enzyme breaks down X Gal that's white and turns it blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so if we see a blue colony that tells us, we have a bacterium that has the pokey team in there it's producing beta gullah societies it's breaking down X Gal from white to blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in other words, we have a functional lack CG. Andrew Ippolito: OK, and now we're gonna break it ready, I want you to look over here so okay so first of all right, we had the last promoter and locked operator, they are that's why this is called an expression vector that gives us the power to express what's ever downstream from that promoter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay immediately so in the beginning of the lack CG right here artificially scientists have put this thing in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called the mcs it's called a multiple cloning site and all it is, is a series of palindromic sequences palindromic sequences that represent the cut sites for just a small library of enzymes and these are those enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: The memorize this but there's ECHO r1 and there's others there's hank to him three the quiet one one sack one SMA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and all these words are funny to say out loud my very first slide but here's a very quick fun story my very first lab meaning ever I was handed a PowerPoint deck that had to give publicly to the lab and within it, it was a.\nAndrew Ippolito: was a cloning protocol step one do this step two, and so one of the steps at the very top of the slide and ball that said.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I had to say, we cut it with restriction enzyme. Andrew Ippolito: buck one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Guy all the giggles and I giggle to and that's the name of the enzyme as well Fuck one.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah. Andrew Ippolito: So it's one of those enzymes has a different word that it does right and so when we're dealing with human genes or you know, whatever gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't pick those sequences Nature did so, what we have to do is read that sequence, and hope that we can find a cut site somewhere in the five prime end of the gene and the three primary thing, so we can cut it out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's a whole tactic itself right that's why we have this mcs so it gives the researcher more a higher chance of finding a good concert.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now let's say that you're dealing with a gene that has none of those cuts sites in it, well then you're not using puppy team you're using 22 that has a whole separate set of mcs sequences.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's a lot of planning that goes into this stuff and in fact the first few weeks of a project, when you first start in the lab is your planning what's called your cloning strategy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your cloning strategy involves picking out the right enzymes in the right sequence is and what you're going to do with it all you have to map out the battle before you do it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, right here is where that mcs is now I want you to think about this, if I cut the plasma right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Look at what that does to the lack CG lakota dose of the product, the the genomic speed ago it breaks it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so when I cut the legs aging open. Andrew Ippolito: I break it if I put it back together again then it's fine again right so ready remember this idea we're going to take the vector.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to think now here's the multiple cloning site and we're gonna cut it with ECHO r1 once that that opens it up right we get the sticky ends here in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys with me Okay, so now imagine we have a test tube filled with a billion copies of puppy team and we sprinkle in some ECHO r1 and we incubate it for 15 minutes and now all of those vectors are split open they're all cut right and they're all we're going around in a test tube.\nAndrew Ippolito: What i'm going to do, then, is i'm going to add to that test tube a billion copies of my insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: Previously, or it was a previously, I have some help come up with this insert and then it also has the same sticky animals there's a billion copies of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then I just incubate them and I cross my fingers and I hope I did everything right and so there's only two champ there's only two outcomes here.\nAndrew Ippolito: The most common outcome which we don't want is that the vector so here's look at my hands for a second here is the vector we opened it now these these are complimentary to each other right so it's just going to do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: is going to close again. Andrew Ippolito: it's so broken right, we still need like ease, but so we call this the empty vector.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't want this, but that happens, most of the time and then rarely.\nAndrew Ippolito: The vector will stick co violently with the insert will call this vector plus insert, and this is what we want.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, but we can't see any of this, this is just invisible on the test tube happening billions of times.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, once we give it some time and we hope for the best we then add some ligation there and what the luggage does is it makes all this permanent right it glues this together.\nAndrew Ippolito: They glues these together, and now we have these permanent, these are very common and pieces of DNA now but, rather, this one is anyway, this one's just it's old paki teen so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So now, the question is how do I distinguish those right, so I take this test tube that has this whole population of vectors and inserts or empty vectors in it, and then I do a transformation reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's go back to the PowerPoint now, so we do this whole transformation reaction now Okay, and I want you to think about what happens in that test tube drink transformation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so ready, we have this test tubes we use white. Andrew Ippolito: Have a test tube and in that test tube we have two populations of molecule we have our closed vector or empty vector and we have our vector plus our insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to use that here's another tube and this tube has a whole bunch of eco lion.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we are going to take our reaction tube and we're going to put a whole bunch in here, not all of it, but a lot of it and we're going to incubate it and we're going to go through this whole protocol for transformation.\nAndrew Ippolito: The incubator on ice for five minutes me heat shock it and we let to recover we do all stuff and then we played it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we played it on ampicillin. Andrew Ippolito: And also X go.\nAndrew Ippolito: We we overnight, I mean go 24 hours 37 degrees.\nAndrew Ippolito: We come in the next day and nothing's there oh that sucks, we have to do all again that's probably what's gonna happen, the first time you do it, and the second, maybe the third.\nAndrew Ippolito: You maybe come in one day and they're all there you see a bunch of colonies, but they're not white and that's because you actually grew up in an emphasis on paper forgot they had the scale.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you have to grow it again and, eventually, you get to the point where you're like okay this place has a good transformation in it it's got X gallon ampicillin the incubator didn't break down overnight.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here I am and I see a whole bunch. Andrew Ippolito: Of i'm Sorry, I see a whole bunch of blue colonies.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, which means what Mr blue colony represent.\nAlison Howard: X scam. Andrew Ippolito: Good which means, so what so remember. Alison Howard: The lacquer that it has a lack of different.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what what so which one of these is is does that represent a or B, that is it the empty vector or is it the vector plus answer.\nBe. Alison Howard: be the vector plus to insert. No.\nAndrew Ippolito: No here's why so this, this is the tricky part ready, so what you're going to get it now, this is what's going to make you understand everything when we add that insert in there, we have interrupted the lexi gene We broke it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So a bacterium that has this will make no functional.\nAndrew Ippolito: beta go. Andrew Ippolito: Without a functional beta Gal it's not breaking down X Gal to make it blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay hey the empty vector has beta gallon it. Andrew Ippolito: it's going to make blue so most of these colonies are going to be blue, whether you like it or not, you're gonna hopefully I mean you're already ahead if you see a bunch of blue that means everything else worked.\nAndrew Ippolito: What you're looking for the holy grail of this experiment is that magic white colony.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so let me draw this in a cleaner way let's look at it from a bird's eye view you're going to see a whole bunch of blue colonies those each one of those college represents a successfully transformed bacterium.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you might see one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Depending on the quality of the insert you gave it. Andrew Ippolito: Like if it was a product of another reaction like a PCR reaction, you might not see it, so you might have to plate let's see your reaction had a I don't know.\nAndrew Ippolito: A whole milliliter of bacteria, you might have to play seven or eight petri dishes and look through all seven of those and look for one of them it has one white because you're looking for the needle in the haystack.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so think about that transformation reaction for a second go back up here think about that transformation, we have here's a bacterium.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we want is for that bacterium to take up our plasmid that includes our insert that's our that's what we want Okay, but there's two other kinds of bacteria in there there's the bacterium that took up the empty vector.\nAndrew Ippolito: This okay so ready this one's going to grow in the presence of ampicillin right.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's going to grow okay in episode, because you got the vector and he's going to keep the X Gal white because he doesn't have better like sightings.\nAndrew Ippolito: This one is going to grow in the presence of ampicillin you're going to see a colony of him, but he's going to be able to functionally break down that beta go i'm sorry the X Gala he's gonna make a blue collar.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you're going to have the lazy bacterium that didn't feel like transforming at all and he's not going to grow at all.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't even see him that's why this plate only has maybe seven or eight colonies on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the President ampicillin only the bacteria that took up the plasmid are going to grow on it, and then the white ones, are the ones that absorbed the or rather were transformed by the plasma that had your fear Regina and search.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what you then do the very last step to all this is, you would take a sterile loop, you would very carefully physically grab that scoop it up put it into a huge flask and grow it in the presence of ampicillin.\nAndrew Ippolito: and the next day you come in and you would have a full leader, or whatever you want of bacteria, where every single one of those trillions of cells is producing your protein of interest or your gene of interest.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then from there sky's the limit, you can do 1000 different things. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, what I would do in lab, or so I did all this with having I wanted to make a protein product for pm, so it was a human protein that I was doing in vitro.\nAndrew Ippolito: Protein interaction assays, and so I would do all this, and I would come in the next day, and I would then pour all this into a centrifuge with pure.\nAndrew Ippolito: spin it all down get the bacteria itself and then we'll put it in a test tube and I would do all this stuff to purify the p amp l protein from it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Using antibodies, and all this fancy stuff it would take the whole process, from start to finish, would take.\nAndrew Ippolito: Two weeks. Andrew Ippolito: To go from here, you know here's your here's a little vial of your plasmid in here some bacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, from that point to here's a tube containing some artificially produced PL protein it's about two weeks.\nAndrew Ippolito: very laborious stuff. Andrew Ippolito: But. Andrew Ippolito: it's at the end of the day, it's kind of exciting because you're you know you're basically purifying the building blocks of life and then asking questions about them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay questions. Michael Caselli: I was just wondering seven like."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Transformation Reaction and Selectable Markers","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the transformation reaction and the use of selectable markers in gene cloning.

Michael Caselli: I was just wondering seven like.\nMichael Caselli: How exactly is there a white bacterial cell in the presence with with.\nMichael Caselli: Like when when there shouldn't be exactly like why, why does it spawn. Michael Caselli: Like I was speaking to you says to like when we have the X Gal President, and then there would be all the blue factory of cells in the white one like, why does it exist.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why does the blue one exist. Michael Caselli: know the white one like the single like the loan white one. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, why does that one exist yeah Okay, so if you go all the way back to the reaction.\nMichael Caselli: here. Andrew Ippolito: The idea of step one is cut the insert. Andrew Ippolito: So we opened it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Step two is to incubate it i'm sorry i'm sorry I said insert let me i'm tired sorry, let me see us again we take our plasmid and we cut it with a restriction, as we open it up step one step two is we incubated with a whole bunch of our insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: At this point. Andrew Ippolito: Most of that vector is just going to close again.\nAndrew Ippolito: But some of it is going to have are inserted.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we have a me like eat it right, we got like so we have a test tube that contains both of those both of this, and this on the same population of molecule we're then going to take that mixture and we're going to add it to bacterial cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the bacterial cells are either not going to take it at all. Andrew Ippolito: they're going to take up one of the more common empty vectors or they're going to take up our vector plus the insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we then want to take that whole. Andrew Ippolito: Little tube of bacteria that are also part of his whole population mixed population or organ i've played all those in the President of both ampicillin and X go Okay, adding the emphasis on ensures that we can get rid of him we don't want him.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, adding the X Gal allows us to distinguish between the two survivors if it's a white colony that tells us it's a containing are our vector that's good if it's a blue colony we don't want that one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is what we mean by a selectable marker it allows us to indirectly determine the presence of our vector positives.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that helped me. Michael Caselli: yeah Thank you. Michael Caselli: you're welcome. Andrew Ippolito: All right, more questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so to summarize this you can say the goal of the first marker is at answering the question is my plasmid present.\nAndrew Ippolito: The secondary selectivity is is my recombinant plasmid present.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's two hurdles to get over is one is did my transformation work at all and to did my insertion work.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you need the two because neither one of the markers alone ampicillin alone or X Gal alone is not sufficient right if I just grew the bacteria nap to ceylan.\nAndrew Ippolito: I would just see bacteria right and there's a one in 1000 chance that the bacteria that I randomly pick from that has my answer it right, so an easier thing to do would be to add with the Expo if I did X Gal alone, I would just grow a whole bunch of bacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I wouldn't be able to distinguish my individual colonies. Andrew Ippolito: I would never find it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the idea, there is untransformed bacteria will grow much faster than transform bacteria, because they have less of a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of having the plasmid is kind of a drag right, you have to it's going to take you a little longer to grow, because you have all this extra stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so the untransformed bacteria is gonna be able to sprint, while the other guys being held down by you know there's 50 pound bag.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you need to hold back the sprinters and let the guy with the 50 pound bag get through it.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what the whole key of selection is okay, and so that's that's the basics of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Bio that's the basics of gene cloning. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now let's say that you wanted to encode a let's see you wanted to create a human gene product you wanted to create like insulin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and we have that pesky promise in terms of next ons bacteria have no idea what to do with those right, so we need a piece of DNA that doesn't have in transit.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so to do that. Andrew Ippolito: We purify from human cells, a bunch of messenger RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you do that remember the poly tales, or you can buy these beads that stick the poly.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you take a boatload of cells you'll blow mobilise and you get a license and you run them on these beads and the only thing that sticks to the beads like little magnets for RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you wash them away you wash the beads until the only thing that's left is the RNA and then you then you can treat them in a certain way that where the RNA falls off the beads and other and solution right, so you purify the Arctic, Mr.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the idea is the cell did all the dirty work for you all the electrons are being cut out all the splicing happened, you now have a splice mature transcript.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, the second thing you do. Andrew Ippolito: Is you take that RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you reverse. Andrew Ippolito: transcribe it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Reverse engineer it to DNA there's an enzyme called reverse. Andrew Ippolito: transcriptase.\nAndrew Ippolito: A major we find these retroviruses like HIV retrovirus genomes or RNA, and so what they do is the opposite of what we do day take RNA and they convert it into DNA and so we're going to take this tool reverse transcriptase RT.\nAndrew Ippolito: or we're going to take our messenger RNA and we're going to run or an RT reaction reverse transcriptase reaction, and so what we call a product of that is complimentary DNA see DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is totally artificial, this is all pure laboratory stuff we take the human Mr na for insulin and we converted into a small piece of DNA called see DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the key is when you see this, and this is only one to come from this is a very important thing when you see see DNA, I want you to think.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is messenger RNA that we have now this long term high quality stable molecule of coding for it right, we can do all sorts of stuff with this, there are things, called CD may libraries, a CD me library is an entire pile of petri dishes that have random.\nAndrew Ippolito: pieces of Mr ne that have been converted to CD throughout them these libraries are what allows us to have access to any.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mr na in the world that's expressed in whatever species, you have the library for so let's say you want to do some research on a particular gene in humans you wanted to work with a particular protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: You would take a CDMA library, he would find the plate that had the gene in it you're interested in, you would grow some of that up and you would purify some of that CD name, so you get the insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so now we have this insert. Andrew Ippolito: made from a piece of Mr na and that insert.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can then use in there, it is a vector plus insert the whole idea of the insert there, so what we can do, then, as we can put that into bacteria like we just walked through.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that bacteria, while now produce a human protein. Andrew Ippolito: Because there's no insurance anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: make sense okay good. Andrew Ippolito: So you can the rest of this stuff you can read through on your own.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay Okay, so this this picture here, this is for those of you who really like the visuals This is like the puppy team picture, but I want you to see this blue part here that's lexi.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this brown parts and multiple coding side so we're going to cut it here we're gonna open it up and then we're going to stick our vector in it and that's what this big.\nAndrew Ippolito: pink part is, and so you can see the remnants of the LACs EG and blue right the original black intact gene is now interrupted by the inserted Dean as well breaks it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, a cell that gets transformed with this vector this recombinant vector will no longer be able to produce a functional being a black societies won't be able to break down next Gal.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it will remain white.\nAndrew Ippolito: questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Almost done here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, this slide here just gives you a summary of what, so why what can we do with this technology well.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can take the gene of interest.\nAndrew Ippolito: make copies of the gene, and then we can do things like put those genes into plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's say that you just okay so here's a real world example let's say that we found this plant in Africa that was really resistant to everything it was resistant a fungus infection was resistant to being eaten by insects, it was resistant to all sorts of things, but it tasted terrible.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was like the worst it tasted like poop.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you take the gene from that plant. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, so you do some research and you realize oh there's a gene here, this is resistance gene so let's take this plant that tastes like poop and take its resistance gene and stick that resistance gene into strawberries.\nAndrew Ippolito: turns up the strawberry cheesecake poop know they're still strawberries. Andrew Ippolito: made he's great, but now they're resistant to all the same stuff that the other plan was resistant to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we just said hey I really like this part of you, but not the rest of you i'm just going to steal this one part i'm going to go put this over here in this dropper.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what we're doing genes for pest resistance.\nSophie Cloutier: question. Andrew Ippolito: yeah but. Sophie Cloutier: The gene inserted into the strawberries be recessive are dominant.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a great question, it would be. Andrew Ippolito: Dominant because. Andrew Ippolito: it's producing an enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is what makes it easy to grow right doesn't matter if they're hybrids or if there's an accidental mutation and it you'd have to be homozygous recessive which is rare right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, or let's say that we are interested in the protein product of the G.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so like there's human kinds of human growth factors that we can have the bacteria produce artificially and now we can treat people.\nAndrew Ippolito: who have diseases, for example, you have people with stunted growth because they don't produce the right growth hormones, so you give them the medicine for it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, or there's proteins that dissolve blood clots.\nAndrew Ippolito: My favorite, though, let me skip ahead of your my favorite. Andrew Ippolito: Where is he hold on i'm going to go all the way to the end of the.\nAndrew Ippolito: way i'm telling the story you guys today. areas.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the tomato tomato tomato.\nAndrew Ippolito: above the ground that makes tomatoes below the ground, it makes potatoes.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a nominal tomato it's a nominal potato it's just in the same plan you've just essentially effectively doubled your farming acreage.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can now take your one acre of land and make twice the amount of food.\nAndrew Ippolito: Simply because you can now just grow more useful things right, a tomato plant has roots a potato plant has roots potato plants don't have much interest on the surface, so all underground their tubers and tomatoes don't have much of interest going under the roots tomatoes or fruits.\nAndrew Ippolito: I thought they were vegetables now their fruits.\nMichael Caselli: I have a question about that tomato. Andrew Ippolito: yeah. Michael Caselli: Would it take like twice as long to to produce it.\nnope. Andrew Ippolito: So the tuber the all the potato is. Michael Caselli: Is.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a storage. Andrew Ippolito: specialization and what the tomato is it's a method for reproduction so in nature that tomato does this thing and the potato does that and then.\nAndrew Ippolito: No plant naturally evolved both of those things, and so we just made this hybrid called it's called so it's called a transgenic plan Okay, a transgenic organism is an organism that contains genes for different bases.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we have created pest resistant cotton pest resistant corn pest resistant potato we've produced soy beans that are resistant to certain herbicides.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we can make plants that have human proteins in them and then purify those.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: We have animals.\nAndrew Ippolito: That can produce human protein so imagine taking the insulin gene and putting it into goats or cows and now milking them and now they're making insulin and their milk and you can just purify the Internet from their milk and milk them as much as you want until they die.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right there's all sorts of things my favorite that I learned about this is back in the 90s."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Applications of Gene Cloning","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explores the various applications of gene cloning.

Andrew Ippolito: hold on a second.\nAndrew Ippolito: Monsanto has these these seeds, that they will sell the farmers and the farmers have to sign a contract saying you're not allowed to grow these past the first season, even though they could.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, when they grow them the plants are completely immune to gli phosphate which is round, so the idea is the farmers can completely destroy any read within a field.\nAndrew Ippolito: plant, the seeds and get a crop yield that's about a pretty much 100% which is awesome that's really good like crop yields are the biggest thing in the brain all like the 20% crop yield would be like an okay farmer 100% crop yield that's what makes these things, the gold standard.\nAndrew Ippolito: The problem is, is that Monsanto has patented this and profits off baldness and farmers that use them get an advantage over farmers that don't, meaning that they might make more money in the year, and so, as a result, they will have more money to buy their equipment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas the farmers that don't use it won't have that money so there's an edge there so some farmers try to.\nAndrew Ippolito: take advantage of the system.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay teach yourself str analysis this isn't hard, the idea is is all of us have specific changes, or rather, all of us have these regions of our genome called short tandem repeats but just stretches over here i'll show you like a gap right and.\nAndrew Ippolito: We all have different numbers of repeats I might have 17 hgtv you might have 27 right and there's only a certain number of variations within the human population, you can think of them like a wheels.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right there's not a one and a two and a three and a four or five there's the 17 or the 27th, for example.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you can then sequence, you can take people's blood samples, and you can run them on gel you can you can look, you can basically use PCR to amplify their sd ours there's 13 of them, we use.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, and so here here's the penta D str, for example, let's just look at one.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a ladder, this is just a control this tells us how big the fragments are okay each sample here is a person an individual.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you can see let's just look at person one here, you see it, they have to yellow bands there. Andrew Ippolito: That means there are heroes like it, they have one band that's really big with many repeats and they have one that has fewer repeats.\nAndrew Ippolito: dramatically differently 1520 or whatever okay person number two they have their also heterozygous they have two different ones three looking for, for I was one band That means they got the illegal for just the they got the same one for mom and dad.\nAndrew Ippolito: No it's not dominant recessive these aren't protein products these aren't protein coding genes, these are just sequences of DNA but we're treating them like a leo's in the sense that we have differences between.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now some of these individuals these unknown people if we look carefully like look at these two right here, see either the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay they're not the same person so some people have the same str so that's just for the penta DST.\nAndrew Ippolito: But if we take those two people here and we look down to the CSF str you see how this person looks like one person, one person, one just has one band for CSF.\nAndrew Ippolito: person to has to so we can distinguish them, the key is we're distinguishing people from each other there's crime scene DNA and then there's a match and it turns out.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you take.

Andrew Ippolito: str the probabilities that any to random people in the human population have exactly the same pattern is a number that's so big the exponent of experience.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you take any all humans that have ever existed and will exist in the next 10,000 years.\nAndrew Ippolito: No two of those people will ever have the same exact match of this, which is why this is essentially 100% accurate in terms of the science behind it Okay, so the accuracy an inaccurate result would be lab air.\nAndrew Ippolito: or contamination they're not science there. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so we call this your genetic fingerprint.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talk about genetic fingerprinting we talked about DNA evidence that's what we're talking about anyone who is accused not.\nAndrew Ippolito: incriminated not found guilty, but accused of a federal crime has a blood sample taken from the Federal Government and they develop an SDR pattern from them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they put them in a date the crime database, so the FBI has what's called the SDR database, the reason we use this this because it's simple to do, but more importantly it's still protect the anonymity of individuals genomes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right they're not they don't sequence your whole genome, they don't have all your genome, that would cost a lot of money, anyway, they just have this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's str analysis. Andrew Ippolito: You don't have to study I cross this out Dini chip technology is actually every year that goes past me here is becoming more and more outmoded.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are better technologies that do the same thing now we use it still.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it's not worth going through learning the techniques here because you're in practicality, the chances of you ever coming across anything like this are very small the concept here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is we can look at the same time across something like 500 or 1000 genes, so we can ask this kind of question which genes in the human genome are turned on in response to this drug.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or what genes in the human genome are turned on or off in this cancer, so we can ask the question multiple genes questions about multiple things as opposed to just is this gene turned on or off.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are these genes turned off okay. Andrew Ippolito: And then the last thing i'll spend any time on here is crispr this, this is the holy grail of a lot of.\nAndrew Ippolito: For a lot of thoughts, the idea of designer babies, the idea of being able to cure genetic diseases it's now within.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our grasp conceptually it's not science fiction anymore we're not there yet, all the way, but every day there are, if you just type crispr in pubmed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every day you'll see the numbers going up people are working on this right now with a laser focus and they're coming out with all sorts of new use cases for it and i'm going to give you the very quick version of this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the bottom line is somewhere in our genome, there is some sequence of DNA we care about.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe we've identified a previously and show that, like this is the sickle cell disease remember GA je n G G right there's a single point mutation there or cystic fibrosis Okay, there is a problem with the the sequence remember all those point mutation we talked about last time.\nAndrew Ippolito: What we're gonna do with that sequence, we can do two things i'm going to teach you two things we can do, one is, we can just shut the gene off the other is, we can fix the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Setting is off is easy Okay, the idea is is we're going to introduce how I can't do that here.\nAndrew Ippolito: I tried to use the eraser let me get to my whiteboard instead.\nAndrew Ippolito: The ideas this we're going to take this double stranded DNA and we're going to introduce a break in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's essential crispr Does it find it hones in on a sequence, and it cuts it that's all those so so what well our DNA repair machinery, then comes in.\nAndrew Ippolito: And fills in a bunch of random nucleotides there to collect together. Andrew Ippolito: it's kind of like a scar scar tissue right there's just some random sequence here that essentially interrupts the gene right so let's say you did that, at the tg start site or the top top box, you can shut off now, so this is gene silencing targeted gene silencing.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the first use case. Andrew Ippolito: The second is so here shut off gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: By adding a double strand break in there. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the second use case is a little more mysterious we don't fully understand how it works, we just know it does work.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to take that sequence and let's see that there's a mutation here that we don't like let's say there's a you know that that's an et that we want it to be a CG.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's a mutation there. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to bring two things into the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: I should step back so here's how crisper works, the first functional piece is a piece of RNA we called the guide.\nAndrew Ippolito: The guide RNA. Andrew Ippolito: As a so hairpin here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the sequence that we care about. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this will match this.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the sequence specificity part. Andrew Ippolito: The second component is an enzyme that binds to that piece of RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: The enzyme is called cast for crisper associated protein and there's cast nine that's the common one that's the one you'll learn about.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of cast nine as a restriction enzyme. Andrew Ippolito: But instead of a restriction as i'm that recognizes a hard coded sequence it cuts what you tell it to buy that guide aren't.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called the died. Andrew Ippolito: And you can synthesize that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So your guide RNA is a little piece of the gene for sickle cell anemia right, and so we can coordinate on it, we can cut it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's how you would do the whole cut it to shut it off part above to fix it, and this is where things are a little more mysterious you get another piece of DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: This like cva or something just double stranded DNA. Andrew Ippolito: That has.\nAndrew Ippolito: The fix in it, so, in other words that has the sequence you want it to be that's the healthy version of the gene the wild type, if you will.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you mix these, together with the cells and somehow what the cell does.\nAndrew Ippolito: After it gets cut by the cast nine protein, it will use that template I should say it will use that piece of DNA you stuck in there as a template to fix this after it's broken and instead of fixing it the way it used to be it'll fix it according to what your templates.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you essentially changed the sequence.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is what's allowing us to edit the human genome, down to the base pair.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the Chinese have already done this. Andrew Ippolito: A couple years ago the world became aware of the fact that they use the crisper has nine system to make an edit into the HIV co receptor gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: People who are naturally immune to AIDS, they still get infected with HIV, but they don't experience the disease.\nAndrew Ippolito: turn out to have a mutation and the co receptor the virus uses to get into ourselves.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it turns out that people with that natural mutation also happen to have a very high level of IQ they're very smart.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the conspiracy theory which is very fascinating is that the Chinese have created babies with this mutation and the hopes that they will grow up to be super smart.\nAndrew Ippolito: create the next generation of geniuses. Andrew Ippolito: They say they're generating people who are immune to HIV that China does not have an HIV epidemic.\nAndrew Ippolito: So one of the most interesting stories of the Semester, you can feel the right type crispr China HIV go see what you can find I haven't I haven't personally research this in a while, maybe somebody here will find something new and interesting on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want to say it's a conspiracy theory but there's that little it's in my brain that's like now there's probably a lot of truth to this.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like basically the United Nations there's there's laws about human experimentation, especially when it comes to genetically engineering there's just it's it's a I wouldn't even say it's a Gray area that has prayed red line there like.\nAndrew Ippolito: You might have crossed it who knows who knows that's a greater crisper is a Gray area because it's so so that's that's crisper in a nutshell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you don't have to worry about I mean i'm really I wish I had all another day to teach you guys this stuff but but I technically don't so here's what i'm gonna say we're gonna draw a line now i'm going to show you were on the slides."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 18 - Biotechnology (Last Lecture)","link":"https://youtu.be/MzQx9SPS53Q?si=ZDs9iaFpUgtb_kj1","chunkTitle":"Conclusion and Exam Focus","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito wraps up the lecture by summarizing the key topics covered and their relevance.

Andrew Ippolito: it's the study of matter in the forces that impact and we talked about force a little bit last time, the idea that for supplies acceleration makes it to work right energies, the capacity to do work and all that stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: But now you're really in order to understand chemistry, you have to mention like fundamentally what's matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Only can say about matter so listen, this is actually something that I learned much later life i'm going to give you now that I really wish I had as a budding scientific student ready there's two kinds of definitions to things okay like definitions themselves.\nAndrew Ippolito: They are are what we call. Andrew Ippolito: operational definition, which is what that definition of matter is notice that it doesn't tell you what it's made out of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we would say that the the definitions of matter, the definition of time, these are these things have operational definitions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because here's what you have to be able to do as a person studying this kind of stuff you have to be able to say, nobody understands it and that's okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, given our lack of understanding of the fundamental nature of things, what can we do with what we have that's that's where we are right, where are with you have to meet the work where we're at.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay don't stress yourself over Oh, what is it like I don't know my first day of physics class.\nAndrew Ippolito: was a nightmare, because I asked my instructor what's the definite can before we move on, can you just give me a simple definition of matter and time.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he just started laughing at me.

He introduces the concept of degrees of freedom and entropy.","start":"4:12","end":"10:12","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Make sure I can do it here we go states of matter all right so. Andrew Ippolito: here's how I want you to see this that you've seen this your whole life, you know what solids liquids and gases are that's not what we're doing here we're not learning about that.\nAndrew Ippolito: But I want you to do is take what you know, and now I want you to apply this concept to it as we go this way I want you to see that as increasing energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and i'm going to now teach you something that we're going to talk about for the rest of the Semester i'm going to invoke this concept constantly everything is always moving.\nAndrew Ippolito: everything's always juggling. Andrew Ippolito: Everything Okay, a single atom has its own what you would call.\nAndrew Ippolito: intrinsic energy. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, sometimes we refer to this intrinsic energy as its heat.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: that's a problem because usually the working definition of heat is the transfer of energy from one system to another.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right warming something up like right now, your butts warming up your seat so there's heat there that's transferring Okay, but you have to keep this in mind, if this is a single atom it's always moving a little bit a never stop that's just a.\nAndrew Ippolito: fundamental concept of it all right so there's a little bit of energy and everything always.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Now, when you consider matter when you consider. Andrew Ippolito: any system of atoms.\nAndrew Ippolito: like this triangle, it was like a bunch of pool balls right, and you can imagine, like they're stuck together, you know they're all each one of these has you know bond they're all stuck together somehow or another.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the other concept here is that there are always multiple.\nforces. Andrew Ippolito: at work on any system.\nmight just miss. system on any system.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the ideas you know there's there's different forces, some of them are positive, some of them are negative but everything's got all these things happening and what we see in the outside world, are our perception of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: is due to the summation of all those forces you add it all together and what he.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and that's and that's reality right our reality is the sum total of all these different fields of different subatomic.\nAndrew Ippolito: particles interacting with each other Okay, and so a solid is a solid, because the forces that hold together those atoms is stronger than those atoms intrinsic energy that wants to fly apart okay so maybe they're cold right so when we talk about temperature now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think about temperature. Andrew Ippolito: The temperature of a system is the average velocity of its molecules right because everything's always moving and so within a solid the temperature is going to be low enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: Such that the intrinsic energy isn't strong enough to push them apart, but they're all going to just kind of sit there like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so like your desk right now, your pen right now, your glasses, the solids doing well they're not moving if we zoomed all the way in at the atomic level, yes, they would be they'd be doing this.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they'd be juggling and and also stuck together okay so let's eat it up let's start heating it up a liquid is when you get to a point where this where the individual atoms or molecules are able to roll around each other okay there's a little bit more freedom there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's another concept of an introduced now, and this idea is called.\ndegrees of freedom. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, all systems have.\nAndrew Ippolito: A degree of freedom or some degrees of freedom it's a number okay. Andrew Ippolito: And what that just represents is how many different states that the system can be in and still be the system right so let's take these little pool balls here.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's see this is A and B just put am being different places right pick up a swap it would be or pick up and swap it over there with another one, as long as they're on that triangle shape it's the same system right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if we counted up the number of different combinations of ways, you can mix all that, together, that would be called that systems number of degrees of freedom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so a solid is constrained. Andrew Ippolito: You could say it like this, therefore solids have.\nAndrew Ippolito: Fewer degrees of freedoms and liquids right, because now now let's make it a liquid less heated up with let's let's let those balls move all over the place, little Adams bop around they're still touching each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so think of your glass of water right the watermark because we're all sticking together a little bit. Andrew Ippolito: Okay there's more degrees of freedom now, though right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So degrees of freedom are going up this way. Andrew Ippolito: Do you also see how the system is more chaotic.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: Do you also see that this would be the natural tendency of any system over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: It would just tend to become more and more chaotic that measure is called entropy.\nAndrew Ippolito: which will learn about when we do thermodynamics in Chapter 689 10, but I want to introduce these concepts to you now because remember, I told you, you gotta chew on things for a while before they start to make a lot of sense okay so entropy.\nIs. Andrew Ippolito: A measure of how far along a system is before it reaches its equilibrium point before it just stops doing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it just stays there so where such that all the items are still doing this they're all jiggling around but there, but the system doesn't change over time at that point that's when we say we reached a state of equilibrium okay."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 1) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/C9JC95HuLzA?si=XaBwNtcKG21O8fyU","chunkTitle":"Exotic States of Matter","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito briefly mentions plasma, quark-gluon plasma, and Bose-Einstein condensate as examples of exotic states of matter.

Andrew Ippolito: have so much energy and then they can break apart from each other, and they can be in this space around them, such that they will fill up the volume of space they're in they will take up the entire bottom of the container they're in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right Okay, so this let's hear solids are these organized they have stable bonds, they have a defined shape.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas a liquid, we would describe is amorphous meaning it doesn't have a defined shape instead you would say that a liquid.\nAndrew Ippolito: takes. Andrew Ippolito: The shape.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of its container. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and, of course, like the way my brain would work you're like well what if it's What if there isn't a container.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well it's not going to have a shape. Andrew Ippolito: is going to lose all over the place right and start spilling and moving until it does have a container.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay gases are the same, you would say both of these are the same, the difference is the gas will continue to expand until it occupies the entire Chamber.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of a balloon. Andrew Ippolito: Right imagine taking a water balloon imagine taking a balloon and blowing it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that it's like this. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now imagine you have the ability to put some water in there.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So it's filled with two things right, so when we say if I showed you, you know the old adage is the class here's a glass.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys are gonna like this because it's gonna this is going to change a little bit of your perspective on life, maybe here's a glass of water is the glass of water half full or half empty, you know the pessimists would say it's half empty, and the optimist would say it's helpful.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the scientists would see it's full. Andrew Ippolito: Half with water were there.\nAndrew Ippolito: huh. Andrew Ippolito: yeah I like that, when I first left forgot how I learned I didn't obviously make that out myself somebody else told it to me and i'm telling you, but once they said that i'm like okay like everything's everything's fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the difference here now is this water will take the shape of the balloon right it's got this hemispherical sheet, but the bottom here was not going to fill up the entire.\nAndrew Ippolito: Space the gas, on the other hand, is going to occupy the whole space that's the difference being the liquid and the gas.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So in gas the atoms are not bound to each other, they collide like pool balls on a table, but in 3D okay everybody's bopping around so you would say their intrinsic energy is pretty high right.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you think about just take water you just just friendly water to all these right solid water is ice is cold add some heat to that now becomes a liquid yeah it's a more heat to that becomes a vapor.\nAndrew Ippolito: What happens if you keep going. Andrew Ippolito: what's this stuff Okay, this is stuff you generally don't learn about when you're when you're a kid.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you're in elementary school, but if you are a kid and listening in right now here's a secret to the universe, that your friends might not know, and that is when Adams get hot enough they end up falling apart, a little bit."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 1) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/C9JC95HuLzA?si=XaBwNtcKG21O8fyU","chunkTitle":"Visualization of Matter","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito shares a video demonstrating the visualization of matter at different magnifications using electron microscopy.

Andrew Ippolito: And then 400 X would be about, as you know that that's a really good place to be with a with a microscope so we're still getting there or 300 400 around here.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's that's the best you get with a light microscope all right, and then you can use the oil immersion lens and get up to 1000 X, which is about here and that's the limit of light.\nAndrew Ippolito: So now we're well beyond the limits of what photons can reveal, and so what we're using now is something called an electron microscope.\nAndrew Ippolito: electrons have much shorter wavelength, and so we can resolve things theoretically that are down to the single atom.\nAndrew Ippolito: rates were 5000 magnification, and now it starts to look like I don't know a key you've got an alien planet.\nAndrew Ippolito: keep going in now we're within the shadows of this little crevice. Andrew Ippolito: And you'll see that there's like this weird black scoring that's the carbon that's a little piece of carbon there's a special name for that, if we were listening to the video it would tell us, but we're gonna keep going here we're at 40,000 X.\nAndrew Ippolito: And by the way this isn't computer simulation these are actual pictures that scientists have taken this is not computer this isn't cgi this is electron microscopy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay we're now at 150,000 next. Andrew Ippolito: are still going how deep this rabbit hole go all the way and now you're gonna start to get a little creeped out and see faces everywhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is hell no i'm just kidding and sorry if you have children lesson and now, this is our brain naturally sees patterns in noise okay we're now at 1,000,001.5 million to 1,000,002 and a half million you're going to start to see.\nAndrew Ippolito: What looks like. The individual items.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now the reason why we can do this with metal is because metals, which are Ionic have very regular patterns of their atoms being laid out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, at this point now you're going to be, are we really gonna go look in quarks now this we're not, this is it.\nAndrew Ippolito: The at this point, this is kind of like taking your camera on your phone and just zooming and what your fingers and getting a digital maximum right so that's the limits of what we can directly visualize at this point.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, yes, we can directly visualize individual items now and we're going to go all the way out.\nAndrew Ippolito: boom. Andrew Ippolito: little bit mind bending okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now i'm not gonna pay the rest of these for you, but if you like that. Andrew Ippolito: Get get my PowerPoint open on your own when you do some studying and watch the skin and the leaf and actually if you dig around on the Internet, you can find an entire series of these kinds of videos they've they've made many since.\nAndrew Ippolito: This i've been showing that they started on seven that's all that is so, since then they've made some other ones that are pretty cool the skin was a little creepy.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know if you if you have a good imagination can translate it like it's a. Andrew Ippolito: It starts out with a person in the grass on their hand and then it's resuming into their hand and you see the skin cells and then you're like oh that's kind of gross Okay, you know if you get if you're like a German patient and watch that one.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right.

Andrew Ippolito: We only see naturally occurring they came from stars all the atoms in existence came from stars Okay, the idea is is when the universe first came into existence through some unknown mechanism.\nAndrew Ippolito: It came along with a tremendous amount of energy and matter and as it started cooling down the matter start coalescing into stars.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then eventually they ignited from their own gravitational pulls and eventually they burn themselves out and exploded sending jets of gas everywhere and those jets of guests would interact with each other igniting new stars.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in the star because of the incredible gravity you'd have all these.

Andrew Ippolito: set to six with that meeting, that means that six protons and is nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and right there that's it everything else about carbon is driven by that think that single fact.\nAndrew Ippolito: The number of electrons it has is informed by the number of protons it has because the protons are positively charged, and so we can bring along with them some negative electrons right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, see you later man, good luck be safe.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this this making sense. Andrew Ippolito: Right it's carbons got six protons always always it's not carbon if that number is different right if that number was seven.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's nitrogen now and it's eight it's oxygen if it's one it's hydrogen right, so this is the defining marker of that object Okay, now the number of protons i'm sorry, the number of neutrons now let's see.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say it has six. Andrew Ippolito: Six protons six neutrons all right as a reminder, a proton, this is a proton which is positively charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: doesn't like being too close to other protons which are also positively charged right they will repel each other from the electromagnetic force.\nAndrew Ippolito: Despite that repulsion carbons got six of these and it's nucleus right so here 123456 i'm just super imposing this on a two dimensional environment so those six protons hate each other, they want to explode and yet here we are we're not exploding.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yet. Andrew Ippolito: And so, why because we have these neutrons in here that are helping to glue them together and it just so happens that carbon has six of them and six of them generally so if we add those two things up, we get a total number of 12 we're gonna call this its mass number.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so.\nAndrew Ippolito: For this instance of carbon. Andrew Ippolito: With this massive 12 i'm going to name this carbon 12.\nor usually it's. Andrew Ippolito: I think it actually I think it's 12 see.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon 12. Andrew Ippolito: Which is stable now there are other atoms, of course, so if we go around the world and we just pluck carbon out of the air and we look at it, we pretend, you can count these things.\nAndrew Ippolito: This carbons got six and six, this cars got six and six, this carbons got six and 690 9% of the carbon that you come across as six protons six neutrons but then about 1% of them blow this one's got this one's got eight neutrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so so I have another one, where I have, I have six protons and I have eight neutrons for a total of 14.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's carbon 14.

Andrew Ippolito: Some number associated with it there's no such thing as just an atom Okay, so you would say, this is the isotopes of carbon and that's the relationship so so an element Okay, we use the word element to describe a family of isotopes that all have the same atomic number.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we can talk about the element carbon in this respective physical and chemical properties, but I can't hold something up and say hey look at this element.\nAndrew Ippolito: That doesn't make sense in English, look at this isotope, we could say look at this item, but then as well, which I said toba which I which kind of Adam is it which isotope is it okay so just like there's no such thing as the ideal cup there's my cup.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's no such thing as the perfect carbon there's this carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's the most common carbon, just like there's the most common soft drink and the most common material to make shirts out of whatever okay so carbon 12 is the most common so when you look at the periodic table now.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you see this number here, and this is very simple atomic periodic table.\nAndrew Ippolito: that number is the mass number right, so you can see 123456 etc okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you see a decimal point, if you look at a more advanced periodic table and you see something like 12.01 okay we've all seen this you can't have a fractional proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have one proton or no protons so the reason why this number exists is because, when we go out in the world and we say 90% of the carbon we find is carbon 12 and tempers are really it's more like 99%.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you know 1% is carbon 14 take a weighted average of all that that's what those numbers are and we call that atomic weight.\nAndrew Ippolito: The atomic weight of an element. Andrew Ippolito: Is the average of the masses of all the respective isotopes we've come across this an empirical number that we determined through experimentation.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't we don't discover the atomic weight, we we calculate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so theoretically imagine we were on the moon, and we took all these samples of carbon that we find on the moon, and it turns out that those ratios are different.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then moon carbon would have a different atomic weight.

Andrew Ippolito: A little weaker than gamma rays, yes, actually know so.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like an x rays X rays or photons I just want to make sure we're clarified here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay X rays are electromagnetic radiation that are just high in energy they're just they have a very tight wavelength so think of like the color red okay X rays are like the color red except there's a different wavelength so they're photons gamma decay or gamma particle is a nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually, technically yeah that's something I never got my head.\ngamma is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, here here's a good website just gives you a good visual here i'll post this into the chat i'll post this into our class chat actually so you can I can't do that, right now, now post this into zoom chat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh gamma Ray photon Oh, they are photons okay i'm wrong i'm glad I looked this up gamma Ray okay so they're just as strong as they're just.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're a little stronger than X rays okay so so the atomics here's the thing when you when you have radioactive decay there's many different things that can happen in the nucleus, one of the things that happens, for example, carbon 14 one of the neutrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the neutrons decays into a proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want to see a neutrino that's where neutrinos coming, by the way, neutrinos are kind of like the the mass placeholders of all these changes, they just shoot out they don't they're not part of the atom they're just.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're kind of like taxes on the universe, or something but, but the idea here is the neutron proton the neutron Dickies into a proton so the carbon 14 transistor nitrogen you just added a proton to the nucleus right, but sometimes when you have these changes photons get admitted.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so gamma emission is a high part it's a high energy photo. Andrew Ippolito: So I was right initially by equating them to X rays.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so they are high enough in energy will they will shred your DNA they'll just keep it up break those Kobe and bonds and they will lead to damage that then sometimes if it's bad enough won't get fixed and you end up getting permanent permanent damage in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay alright so that's that's radiation, in a nutshell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the question here, why does hair fall out and the stomach give us trouble after this, how do you have to this should be radiotherapy not chemotherapy."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 1) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/C9JC95HuLzA?si=XaBwNtcKG21O8fyU","chunkTitle":"Radiometric Dating and Half-Lives","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the concept of radiometric dating and the use of radioactive isotopes with long half-lives to date rocks and geological formations.

Andrew Ippolito: The reason why their hair falls out after that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Really, I mean during chemotherapy too, but we're talking about radiation here is because.\nAndrew Ippolito: So cancer is something i'll teach you this semester, as we get through it slowly in bits and pieces, because you can't just learn cancer, you have to learn biology, for it, but the ideas of the cells are growing and they're not supposed to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: When they're not dying when they're supposed to be, and so, most of the cells in your body as an adult aren't going through division there in the state of arrest.\nAndrew Ippolito: The cancer cells aren't okay now some your cells are going through cell division your skin cells basically any cell that's in touch with the environment so think of the the lining of your stomach think of your hair think of your skin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you're constantly producing yourself So those are the ones that are going to get nailed from radiation therapy because they're cycling.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're going through cell division so they're going to die, and so you'll lose your hair and you'll have skin issues also a UV light labs strong it so you so ultraviolet radiation is called ionizing radiation it's not strong enough to.\nAndrew Ippolito: cleave bonds, instead, what they do is they make the electrons high enough energy where they start bouncing around a bit so they'll they'll.\nAndrew Ippolito: UV is well Ionized things it'll cause them to gain or lose charge, so it dangerous to it's not as dangerous as gamma Ray and our bodies have evolved under a son that provides us with a lot of UV light that's why we can, for example.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so ultraviolet radiation is like too much of it for too much exposure over very long periods of time will also lead to cancer, particularly skin cancer.\nAndrew Ippolito: The the vast majority of the damage you do to yourself from the sun happens up until the age of about 12.\nAndrew Ippolito: So if you're older than 12 which most of you are. Andrew Ippolito: And you did not get out much as a kid and get sunburned all the time at the beach.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can probably go enjoy the sun now because the reason is is as you're growing right your skin's growing too, and so all those cells are rapidly growing so from the age zero to 12 is when most of that growth happens.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if you're exposing that person that kid to the sun chronically that's going to lead down the road to a higher likelihood of skin cancer right don't but you know not 100% it's just more likely.\nTaylor Campbell: I have a question. Andrew Ippolito: yeah go ahead killer. Taylor Campbell: How about like how scars like and and like with sons so like scars supposedly like a darker if there.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah oh so so scars. Andrew Ippolito: Are when we have our skin damage to deeply scar tissue is just.\nAndrew Ippolito: dense connective fibers it's not all the old stuff that used to be there, and so a scar is fundamentally different tissue it's a different tissue type and it's denser.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it resides just underneath the surface of your skin and that's what you can see it that's what the score is and so that will have a lower density of mulana sites in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: The mulana Center the cells that respond to the radiation that that elicit the production of the melanin and so you're going to have a discoloration in that area nationally.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's finally gone now, when I was like 12 I have a line right here, and it was just kind of a deep simple slice from a tree branch, but I was very pan.\nAndrew Ippolito: At the time, and I had that scar there, it was always discolored to my skin until probably.\nAndrew Ippolito: My late 30s I started I just noticed it was gone like was just part of my identity, I just had this line here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then one day was just gone finally so so yeah, it has to do with the fact that it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we won't heal our skin and it's too deep it never comes back exactly as I was there's just a little bit of connective tissue damage or its connective tissue not muscle and neuron and and mulana sites and all that.\nTaylor Campbell: But don't they change color in the sun. Taylor Campbell: Like feeling like I just like.\nAndrew Ippolito: They will pan differently. Taylor Campbell: yeah like I work with this girl, she was in a horrible motorcycle accident so she's like covered right and like scars and she doesn't like to go out in the sun, because it makes her scars darker.\nAndrew Ippolito: So then, during the wound healing there she had more Milan so it's different so.\nTaylor Campbell: it's a different composition of cells, at that point understood.\nTaylor Campbell: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright So what do we use it, for we use it for a lot of things, and this is more of the health science area stuff so I don't want to spend too much time on this.\nAndrew Ippolito: But there's plenty of medical diagnostics that use some kind of radiation and other way, you have to swallow a whole bunch of liquid so they can light up your intestinal tracts and look for blockages.\nAndrew Ippolito: or they'll use radioactive glucose, which is an indicator of metabolic activity and so cancers because they're constantly dividing will use more sugar than other tissues and you'll see hotspots like like in this picture over here this pet scan.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: we'll we'll we'll see that we use radiation for various ways of tracing things through systems so like imagine a radioactive virus particle or radioactive protein and we can track where that protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: or even a radioactive element let's say that you were trying to understand something about DNA itself, and if you use radioactive phosphorus.\nAndrew Ippolito: You put put radioactive phosphorus with a bunch of bacteria and you just let them use it they'll take that radioactive phosphorus and put it into their DNA and now you have radioactive DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can do purification and you can watch them go through division and you can track where the radiation goes, and you can answer questions that way that's actually the technology we use to determine how DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: replicates through semi conservative replication i'll teach you that later in the Semester to.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is just this is just fun, I had to get an MRI a couple years back, because of my ear issues and i've never seen them, you can you a desk and you can basically cruise through your entire.\nAndrew Ippolito: head in 4d. Andrew Ippolito: And it's one o'clock thanks Julia Thank you, I appreciate that because i'm not looking at the clock so anyway that's just that's just cool it's really weird and creepy looking at your own head and being able to scroll the mouse wheel and go in and out.\nAndrew Ippolito: The bird's eye view I was able to see my deviated septum look at the top down on my nose instead of like you're supposed to have this like wow that just separates the two rate minds like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's just I was like Oh, it was like dramatic it was like okay that's not we were there for but still.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, it's your brain so i'll end it's one o'clock will end here and i'll say that if we have a quiz on Wednesday, it will cover basic chemistry up to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Radio metric dating. Andrew Ippolito: As a concept we already talked about this, we use it to date i'm not going to ask you, you know what what does potassium decay to.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, lead to a six lead to I won't do that to you ever i'll see that, for your chemistry right, but the potassium potassium are gone that's the one we use for a lot of this is the common one, we use for measuring rocks because look at the half life 1.2 billion years.\nAndrew Ippolito: It takes one if you have one gram of potassium 40 it will take 1.2 billion years for half of that to go down into are gone 40.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so here's one of the crazy things if you look at the half life here. Andrew Ippolito: you'll notice that they're either really, really old.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: or. Andrew Ippolito: But actually let's even include aluminum there or they're almost really oh they're super young carbon 14 as a radioactive decay rate of 5730 years there's no observable radioactive isotopes on earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Between 740,000 years and 5730 years they exist, we can find them, we can do things in the lab to make them, I think I think that's how we do it, but there's none observed, and the only explanation that we have is that Earth is so old.\nAndrew Ippolito: That all traces of those radioactive isotopes have since the kid past the point of being able to detect them.\nAndrew Ippolito: A young earth would have a whole bunch of different isotopes of all different.\nAndrew Ippolito: Years right we'd have isotopes with 10,000 years and 20,000 years and 70,000 years instead we just have these ancient ones or ones that are renewed in the atmosphere regularly, which is exactly what carbon 14 is when carbon 14 when carbon 12 gets hit by I think.\nAndrew Ippolito: cosmic rays, it turns into carbon 14. Andrew Ippolito: So there's this constant refreshing have it in the atmosphere so, otherwise we just don't see them.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're gone and here's, the last thing i'll leave you on this note rubidium 87 has a half life actually."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 1) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/C9JC95HuLzA?si=XaBwNtcKG21O8fyU","chunkTitle":"Conclusion and Quiz Announcement","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito concludes the lecture and announces an upcoming quiz on basic chemistry and radiometric dating.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so the way carbon dating works is earth's atmosphere has a constantly replenishing supply of carbon 14.\nAnd the reason is is. Andrew Ippolito: cosmic rays come in and hit various it hit um I think it's the nitrogen in the atmosphere and it converts it into cover 40 okay so it's constantly being replenished.\nAndrew Ippolito: That half life of carbon 14 or something like 5760 years I can never remember the exact number.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe 30 5700 years. Andrew Ippolito: Of course, what that means is, if I have one gram of carbon 14.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I allow 5700 years to pass I will have one half of a gram OK, so the key to radiation is, of course, we don't know exactly when an atom is going to decay.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can just say, on average, it happens around this frequently okay that's part of the craziness of quantum mechanics quantum mechanics is not something that is discreet and predictive it is it's a blurry averaging of things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right, so what this means is. Andrew Ippolito: Any biological sample so so think about what what happens a carbon carbon gets absorbed by our producers.\nOkay, the things that photosynthesize. and your plants, you have some algae.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have your cyanobacteria i'm just gonna re you have all these things to do photosynthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what those things do is they produce organic compounds. Andrew Ippolito: Organic molecules and those organic molecules have carbon in them, that is both see 14 and see 12 okay so there's a ratio between carbon 14 and carbon 12 and all living tissue that is the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason is this organic molecules and eaten by a consumer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, which then uses that molecule, among other things, to break down and make some energy and it releases it back into the environment as carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's the carbon cycle. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so the trees out your backyard sequester carbon from the atmosphere, they make their molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then something eats them and something else it's that thing and something else it's that thing to eat it that's all of the food chain and all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, all that cognitive he found his way back into the atmosphere Okay, so long as life is alive, it will be constantly in flux, with its carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you're taking it in your breathing it out you're taking in your breathing, and so the ratio of your carbon 14 and carbon 12 is always the sea Okay, when you die.\nAndrew Ippolito: You go into the earth you're down here now. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: You stop eating. Andrew Ippolito: Just copy is right you're dead you're not eating anything, and so the carbon 14 that you were buried with.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or the Carter 14 that the little bunny was buried with the car before 10 of the insect was buried with whatever the ratio starts to change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because the carbon 14 that has been trapped in there begins to break down begins to the cat radioactively, and so we can take any biological material that we find in the earth that's old Egyptian mummies pieces of papaya iris whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we can go into the lab and we can measure the amount of carbon 14 that's still in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there are there's a bunch of math and statistics and what they can do, then, is they can estimate the age of that thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now, the problem is is eventually that carbon 14 because, as a half like 5007 or six years will eventually get to a point where it's beyond.\nAndrew Ippolito: The ability to detect any. Andrew Ippolito: or really or it's all God it's all decayed and so once you're at that point that takes about 75,000 years.\nAndrew Ippolito: So anything that's older than 75,000 years. Andrew Ippolito: cannot be accurately.\nAndrew Ippolito: dated all you can say is this dinosaur fossil is is older than 75,000 years.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's all you can say. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, how do we know that dinosaurs like T REX bones are 65 and a half million years there's different items that have different half lives alright, so if I go over here and I look at this, this is a, this is a table from a book called the greatest show on earth."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Radioactive Isotopes and Half-Life","chunkSummary":"Discussion on the concept of radioactive isotopes and their half-life, including examples of different isotopes and their decay rates","start":"5:22","end":"9:30","content":"Andrew Ippolito: by Richard. Andrew Ippolito: dawkins if you don't know who Richard dawkins is at this point, you should know he's a famous evolutionary biologist and as a budding biologist yourself, you should know some of the famous biologists and bless you bless you.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so Richard dawkins is one of these people, that you can call my science evangelist he's he's famous he goes on TV he has specials he writes books he's a little cantankerous a little insulting to some people.\nAndrew Ippolito: He rub some people, the wrong way, I think, in real life is a little bit of a jerk but he's uh he's pushed a lot of ideas in modern biology that suck so, for example, he wrote a book called the selfish.\nAndrew Ippolito: Gene I read this back in college self the shots the selfish gene that's a book, if you want to read it read it it's a nonfiction book it basically postulates he builds a case that the smallest unit of of evolution isn't the organism.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the gene itself that genes are trying, like the sequence of the gene is the thing that tries to survive into the future and it uses us basically as a vessel for that, and of course not.\nAndrew Ippolito: not like it has an intelligence and it's like i'm going to survive as a sequence it's just it just happens to be that way, like you know mathematical sense so it's good it's good it's good it's a good case he builds a good case for it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, that's that's so that's called radio metric dating when we pick any one of these isotopes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we can see decay to this one, and we look at the half life you're like rubidium to strontium has a half life of that that's.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, five times longer than the age of the entire universe 49 million years of a half life it's crazy right and, in fact, there was a news article a couple months ago.\nAndrew Ippolito: So scientists in order to estimate these numbers right So how do we know it's 49 billion years, so what we do is, we have a sample of this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we we listen we for the Geiger counter to go off basically we we see if we can capture a decay of an atom in a moment, and it turns out, they found one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they were able to more accurately measure the half life, based on whatever just happened so so that we get these numbers from from empirical observation now there's one really interesting thing here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that is there is a very, very solid line between, and this is this is talked about in this book here.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a very, very solid line here between isotopes that have a very long half life Okay, like the iodine xenon of 17 million years.\nAndrew Ippolito: And aluminum 26 to magnesium which is 740,000 years right there's a gap there, in other words, if you were to plot out.\nAndrew Ippolito: A bar chart of the relative abundance of the isotopes on earth, that we observe in the crust of the earth, we would see, let me draw this better here, we would see.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is just all the different isotopes that we come across on the earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: We would see and then this right here, this is carbon carbon 14 we would see this big gap here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where there's no naturally occurring isotopes the half half lives younger than 740,000 years.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, based on my explanation on how we did dinosaurs and how we can't be done so, the carbon right because the dinosaur bonus so old that all the quarter 14 is gone that right, there is one of the best piece of information we have.\nAndrew Ippolito: that the earth is genuinely and truly is four and a half billion years old, not that we're dating a rock but there so which we do do.\nAndrew Ippolito: But also there's this complete absence of isotopes.

Angela Harbeck: This is the stuff you want to pay attention to. Andrew Ippolito: This is going to be everywhere, for the. Angela Harbeck: rest of the Semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: But before I do that let's see if there's any questions guys. Angela Harbeck: I have a question like i'm a little bit confused with the carbon dating and then the radio metric dating so it's, just like the both of like the dating things they just have to do with the decay over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not sure what your question is. Angela Harbeck: Well, like. Angela Harbeck: You said, like for. Angela Harbeck: Like bones and stuff like that, if they run out of like the time for carbon and they.\nAndrew Ippolito: don't get here let's let's say this is a dinosaur bone. Angela Harbeck: it's a fossil, of course.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right there's not actual calcium in there, so that's that's the first problem is is there's no carbon anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's no carbon, to begin with that's The first reason you really can use it it's more of a practical one but let's say that we found some soft tissue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we have a big dinosaur bones cracking half and we find in the deep part of it we find some bone marrow which they've done before you can actually get some DNA out of their to the carbon 14 that's in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is none, because the rate of decay of this is so quick compared to the age of the dinosaur rate so for every 5700 years if you multiply that out like how many.\nAndrew Ippolito: How many half lives are there and 65 million years, so you take 65 million divided by 5700 and I don't know what you get you get some really, really huge number, to the point where that's going to tell you that all of the carbons God.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, whereas if you find a little mouse bone like an actual bone in the earth. Andrew Ippolito: You know, deep let's say you're excavating to build a house and somewhere deep in there, you find a bone of something.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can take that to a lab and they can pull the cart they can do a sampling of it and they can tell you that the ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: of carbon 14 to carbon 12 is some number, whatever that number is, and you can plug that number into an equation that people have put together, and you can calculate how old that boat is based on the rate of decay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does that make sense. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so just that idea can be applied to any of these pairings This is called I think they call this the parent and.\nAndrew Ippolito: The child I can't remember the denominator don't they call it the daughter or the child I can't remember, but basically that that relationship so like.\nDanuta Despagne: ribbit just take the first one. Andrew Ippolito: rubidium at seven to strontium right rubidium as the parent isotope or the parent Adam and strontium would be the child or whatever word they use like Cameron.\nAndrew Ippolito: daughter. Danuta Despagne: got his daughter okay thanks. Andrew Ippolito: The daughter, the daughter Okay, and then there are there are clusters of decay so like one atom would decay to another atom which would decay to another atom which would take so there are multiple.\nAndrew Ippolito: decays sometimes and it just it's just not on this table, but that's another thing that happens.\nAndrew Ippolito: Until Finally, the whatever this last thing is that's the final resting place that's the most stable of the items.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's not it's not it's not radioactive anymore.\nVictoria Bloemker: Okay quick question yeah I know you like already clarified it like twice, but i'm carbon dating would you consider that i'm determining the age of like an object to using the isotopes of carbon, whereas radio metric feeding is just.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's not if it's not carbon dating we can just. Andrew Ippolito: generically call it radio metric dating if it's the potassium argon clock, which is the most commonly used them rocks we would call that potassium dating.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or maybe argon dating I don't know I pray potassium at they're looking for the potassium.\nVictoria Bloemker: Are they looking for the Oregon. Andrew Ippolito: Now they have looked to the potassium our guns gas, so you can't find a gas in a rock.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's read a little bubbles in there, but maybe that's possible I don't know i'm not a geologist damaging mama molecular biologist not a joke.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know I don't have a good answer for you, but I can say did that answer your question I missed the kind of beginning of it, so if you want to ask it again in a different way.\nTaylor Campbell: So radio metric is that. Taylor Campbell: Little group and then each one of those are the specific so carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah. Andrew Ippolito: This is the generic idea, a radio. Taylor Campbell: Radio attic.\nAndrew Ippolito: Radio metric. Andrew Ippolito: Radio active Adam to king and taking advantage of the fact that this rate of decay is a constant as far as we can tell in the universe it never changes there's nothing you can do to a radioactive isotope.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's nothing you can do to a radioactive isotope to change its half life.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's one of the constants now that's that's one of the assumptions of science remember go back to day one, when we learned about the assumptions of science and assumption number two.\nAndrew Ippolito: Was this continuity in the laws of physics and math basically throughout space and time so yeah it's possible that 2 million years ago something happened in the universe that changed all the half lives.\nAndrew Ippolito: But there's no way we could ever know that, and so we have to work with what we got now. Andrew Ippolito: there's no change in temperature or pressure or density or the distance from gravitational masses that changes the rate of decay there's nothing we can do it's always the see like the speed of light it's a constant.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we use that to our advantage okay all right. Andrew Ippolito: We got some big fish to fry today not talk about electrons wouldn't talk about electrons all semester, so it is very important that you understand this stuff This is like the the, the most important.\nthing to learn.

Andrew Ippolito: So we talked about the configuration of electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: surrounding an atom. Victoria Bloemker: You go back to that slide just really quickly. Victoria Bloemker: Thank you you're welcome.\nAndrew Ippolito: So in electron let's talk about electrons electrons are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Pure okay so they're the elementary particles they're not made out of things that we understand they don't have a substructure they are thing they are a thing, and an electron is so it's it's matter okay it's made out of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whatever it's made out of its matter, which means that it has mass, which means it takes up some space right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So two electrons can't be in the same time, at the same place right they can't overlap each other, so to speak, no more than you can take your hand and push them into each other and be in the same place.\nAndrew Ippolito: So for a single electron.

Andrew Ippolito: Right remember energy is the capacity to do some work.\nAndrew Ippolito: So electrons are defined in Part one of the most important.\nAndrew Ippolito: characteristics that an electron has is the amount of energy they helped Okay, and they can also give it off again okay so that's the nature of an electron it can capture and release energy by.\nAndrew Ippolito: By holding onto a photon or letting go of it to the mechanisms, nobody understands.\nAndrew Ippolito: You try to read about this there's nothing out there, we just we talking very big generalities here, so what I want you to do is just kind of imagine in your head electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like picture, like a marble sitting on the floor versus hovering versus being really up here right it's got more and more energy or here, this is the analogy generally use me fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can think of an electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah I have my I have a whole box of toys that I used to teach with that box behind, I have to pull that out again, I mean let's do this.\nlet's take this piece of. junk mail.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's not junk mouse taxes, I have to do taxes at some point, but here on a puncture a hole in this okay so let's pretend, this is just put a little push pin in here has a rubber band so let's see this little.\nAndrew Ippolito: girl you see it that well let's say that this pin represents the nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm gonna take this rubber band here okay i'm not gonna i'm just gonna i'm just gonna hold it gently so i'm putting a little energy into it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I want you to think of the rubber band to the amount of energy has in it, not too much. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can imagine, this isn't too steep layer you can imagine, I can rotate this in three dimensional space wherever I want, but i'm constrained by that amount of energy right, so I can I have this defined.\nAndrew Ippolito: region of space, I can move with it, and no more now let's say that I put a little more energy into the rubberband.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now it's under tension, this is a high energy electron it's going to tend to go down in energy right.\nAndrew Ippolito: When it's out here, though it has a different space to traveling so that's the concept here of what you would call the energy levels.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so all electrons have one feature called their energy level.\nAndrew Ippolito: In more advanced physics, we would call this one of its quantum numbers all particles have a set of quantum numbers one of their quantum numbers is energy level, and that is a whole number, and it can equal one or two or three or four etc.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we sometimes interchangeably use the freeze shell.\nWith energy level. Andrew Ippolito: So there's Shell one Shell to Shell three, and these are just vague.\nRegions of space. Andrew Ippolito: And their imaginary they're not actual shells Okay, in the same way, take take the sun and take the earth and imagine the trajectory that the earth takes around the sun every year.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and now blow earth up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sorry you're not here anymore, the orbit still there right, I mean there's still the space is still there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where if I put a new rock here with the same mass and the same rate of movement and all that it would eventually establish the same more of it right, so the orbits there that's the Shell it's just this invisible region of hypothetical space.\nAndrew Ippolito: That can occupy and electron. Angela Harbeck: I know, in the lab it was talking about how like the electrons will jump from different like orbital like.\nAndrew Ippolito: don't don't invoke the word orbital yet we'll get there. Andrew Ippolito: Just just keep listening all eventually build everything up that I say tell you today will make the lab make perfect sense.\nAngela Harbeck: Okay, hopefully. Angela Harbeck: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: let's go back here now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now what i'm about to teach you. Andrew Ippolito: is equivalent to let's say you were playing a complicated overly complicated board game with one of your friends right everybody's got that friend that likes playing those insanely complicated games with like resource management and little tokens and cards and I hate those Games.\nJordan Russell: I am said friend. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah there, he is okay, my friend Jason next door, he has an entire library of those kinds of games and do you want to play.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it was like I just i'm tired I have when you have kids you get tired easily, you have just there's just so much energy you don't have mental space anymore to learn.\nAndrew Ippolito: A game that has an instruction manual that's basically an encyclopedia it just can't do it, I when I was younger I like those kinds of games, but as i've gotten older and my brains been occupied with other things, not so much.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but in those Games there's all these seemingly arbitrary rules that make no sense that you just gotta go along with.\nAndrew Ippolito: It that's pretty much quantum chemistry, for lack of a better phrase okay so here's the rules ready we're gonna learn about the rules of electrons of Rule number one electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like. Andrew Ippolito: To pair. Andrew Ippolito: They have to pair.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the most important feature of an electronic. Andrew Ippolito: Electronic be they're found in pairs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now one of the aspects of it is remember, I told you that they have some energy level.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, they also have something called speed.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call it spin we describe it is either clockwise or counterclockwise but understand this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And electron is not on little marble that's actually spinning, this is just what our poor human brains can understand.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in reality, think of it more like a flashing is either flash daughter flashed off last night, and so this makes more sense now or think of waves right these things are all waves to imagine a way that looks like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's electron one and then, if I hear if I change my color here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Imagine electron to. Andrew Ippolito: Is the exact opposite.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when you add that, together, you get nothing right so that's the idea of electrons always pairing of opposite spins.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because really it's more like this. Andrew Ippolito: Right that's the idea there so electrons always pair and they can only pair with an electron that has an opposite spin.\nOkay. So I want to I was like the PIC. Andrew Ippolito: that's arguably the most important thing here okay i'm gonna go back to read.\nwhich read the bright red number two.\nAndrew Ippolito: electrons are found.\nIn. Andrew Ippolito: orbitals okay so orbitals.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are the actual location of the electrons forget the shells okay an orbital.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a defined region of space it's a.\ndefined. region of space.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where. Andrew Ippolito: The electron.\nwill most likely. be found.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mostly likely be found, sometimes it's not there. Andrew Ippolito: 5% of the time, the electrons doing something secret.\nthat's the best I can say. that's weird yes that's weird quantum mechanics is very strange.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now so orbitals are the actual things we deal with.\nAndrew Ippolito: The next rule here is really a set of rules, these are like the principles of the shells Shell number one.\nAndrew Ippolito: holds. Andrew Ippolito: One orbital.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, let me add something else to to i'm sorry they're always found in orbitals. Andrew Ippolito: which are defined regions of space and we would say orbitals hold.\nAndrew Ippolito: Two electrons and only two electrons and always two electrons right, so they like to pair so they're always they're always parent within an orbital okay so orbitals all hold two electrons always.\nAndrew Ippolito: So Shell number one holds one orbital it's it's it's small and so it's only big enough to hold one orbital."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Quantum Mechanics and Electron Behavior","chunkSummary":"Discussion on the strange rules and principles of electron behavior in quantum mechanics, including the concept of orbitals and energy levels","start":"27:26","end":"31:38","content":"Andrew Ippolito: I see chat messages coming in here yeah go ahead, go ahead or.

Andrew Ippolito: know I will never ask you a question on this. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and then she'll number three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is really the limit of the atoms we deal with in biology shall number three also holds.\nFor orbitals.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So these orbitals are real things, these are the trajectories of the electrons so electrons are always moving.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's one thing I wanted to get in your head is that the electron is never sitting still they take these shapes in the same way, I want you to picture in your head a guitar.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to pluck the string of the guitar and I want you to imagine somebody took a high speed video of that guitar string moving and be like whoa whoa right, it would be moving like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: A guitar string I want you to just think of this for a moment let's say that this is the fret, and this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: What they call the other down down towards the head, but that's a string that is is anchored in place in two places right guitar string is fastened into places as under tension, so when you pluck it.\nIt will form what's called a standing wave. Andrew Ippolito: A stamp this the physics thing a standing wave.\nAndrew Ippolito: As as opposed to I don't know what the other kind is called but think of an ocean wave or soundwave just propagates in space.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're not talking about that this is a standing wave just locked in there, and so you can imagine that, but this, so the reason why a guitar string has a particular frequency.\nAndrew Ippolito: or pitch when you hear it a low pitch or a high pitch is driven by.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the very well, because the guitar has multiple strings in the same distance of the thickness of the string helps us determine that right, but let's say that we instead we're able to very the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Really i'm getting carried away here we don't worry about that just understand this as a vibrating right Doug a tie, a jump rope to your door knob.\nAndrew Ippolito: and stand, apart from it and just do this to it the same idea or if you still have, if your House still has a telephone with a court on it and take the Court off the wall and do it with that that's what he's doing lab when we had our class phones still.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can imagine if you're playing the play that game today if you can't get a rope tied to something and just do this right and you're gonna realize the second or maybe you've done this before so just go back in time to when you've done this before.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to whip it at a certain rate in order to get it to be going right you can't, just like the reader with your hands up and up and down.\nAndrew Ippolito: can be anything, it has to be a specific rate at which you oscillated and if you get good at it right so here let's say this is your door, and this is you holding this rope if you get good at it.\nAndrew Ippolito: You might be able to make. Andrew Ippolito: sure that. Andrew Ippolito: I have to draw this perfectly I see if I could do this again.\nAndrew Ippolito: There you might be able to get it, so you have you know, two two waves there Okay, if you go really fast, you might even be able to four.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but, most people, I think it probably will get to about three before you just you just can't go faster than that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but you get the idea there that these are specific amounts of energy you're putting into your hand, you can there's there's one and two and three and they're your energy levels."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Quantum Mechanics","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of quantum mechanics and how it relates to the behavior of electrons in atoms.","start":"31:48","end":"32:18","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay that's why that's why we called quantum mechanics one or two or three because electrons are three dimensional standing waves, there are two constraints.\nAndrew Ippolito: don't worry about what they are just understand that they're vibrating at specific frequencies we call those are energies and there's energy, energy, energy three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, Shell one shelter shelter.

Andrew Ippolito: So when an electron is living in one of the shells like Shell one and it absorbs energy it can go up to a second show, or even a third show sometimes and then it can fall back down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, these movements are called quantum leap. Andrew Ippolito: a quantum leap which is also the name of agreed ease TV show starring Scott bachelor.\nHas a wonderful theme song to you. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: This is how your lights work, the reason why you get light bulbs, so the idea, there is that you throw some electrons in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, high energy electrons and that brings the electrons that are within the tungsten up and then down when they fall down to give off photons and we can see with them.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright So here we go, how are the electrons present distributed within the atom alright so again we see the shells this imaginary boundary.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the orbitals the actual trajectory. Andrew Ippolito: And they always hold a maximum two electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And shells what multiple orbitals therefore can hold more than two electrons right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's this thing called the octet rule or the rule of eight and that's just shells, two and three hold the electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Again, you just memorize that that's one of the just why who knows okay So here we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll go to the blackboard for a second, I just want to see if I have yeah there we go So you see this picture here, I just wanted to get this idea in your head like this is what they look like they're these cool weird 3D vibrations like waves."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Distribution of Electrons in Atoms","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains how electrons are distributed within an atom, including the concept of octet rule and the maximum number of electrons in each shell and orbital.","start":"33:57","end":"36:09","content":"Andrew Ippolito: i'll go to the blackboard for a second, I just want to see if I have yeah there we go So you see this picture here, I just wanted to get this idea in your head like this is what they look like they're these cool weird 3D vibrations like waves.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay alright so here's here's how it works Shell one.\nAndrew Ippolito: can hold two electrons right. Andrew Ippolito: They are found within a single orbital that is a solid sphere sheet.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call this the one s orbital or just one ass. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so somewhere in there there's two electrons I like to think of them they're always on opposite sides they hate each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: right they hate each other they're electrons they're both negative right, so they repel but they're attracted to the proton so there's this constant there you go OK.\nAndrew Ippolito: So solid, in other words the electron can be found anywhere in there, not the surface, this isn't an eggshell, this is a solid ball.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that electron to be found, those those two electrons be found anywhere in there at any moment.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, think of that think of the shells i'm sorry rather think of these orbitals as probability clouds.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are regions of space where the electrons are most likely found. Andrew Ippolito: they're moving so fast it's kind of like when you're driving in the car and you look at the car next to you that's driving and you look at the hubcap of the car driving it looks like a blur right because it's going so fast that's what this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, still with me. Just nod your head.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some people are not nodding their heads, that means that there's something that I could explain better.\nTo ask me a question.\nNo. Andrew Ippolito: All right, last chance unless you're gonna say i'm completely lost, then they may completely lost.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right here we go Shell number two.\nAndrew Ippolito: Shell number to remember is bigger now bigger space we hold a total of eight electrons."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Understanding Orbital Shapes","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito describes the shapes of different orbitals, including the s, p, and d orbitals, and how they determine the probability of finding electrons in specific regions of space.","start":"36:09","end":"41:50","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Shell number to remember is bigger now bigger space we hold a total of eight electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so 2468 there's going to be four different.\nAndrew Ippolito: orbitals Okay, the first orbital of shells number two is also a sphere shape, but this fear shape has a hole in the middle.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: That little hole in the middle, I like to think and I don't know if this is true or not that's this one over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like Shell number one hiding in there, the way to visualize this is to take an egg and hard boil it and then cut it in half, and then scoop out the yolk.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and you picture you got that hole in the middle of it. Andrew Ippolito: that's the second Shell okay so there's a there's a solid next to it and it's got a scoop taken out in the middle.\nAngela Harbeck: Okay, so they can be found, like the electrons they can be found with in that Shell like, not just on the outer part of the show.\nAndrew Ippolito: Exactly anywhere in there. Angela Harbeck: except the middle okay. Andrew Ippolito: So we call these spaces nodes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's go back go back to the jump rope example. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, if I took imagine, I had a jump rope and it was making that ship now take a time take a picture of it, whereas a long exposure What would it look like right, so the jump rope would do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it would do this right eventually what it would look like.\nAndrew Ippolito: would be this right this, this would be the full path of that jump rope attached to the wall and you see in the middle here if you did it perfectly that part of the jumper wouldn't move at all it'd be a dead zone right.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a node that's what that thing is in three depot so the hole in the middle that's kind of what that is it's the absence.\nAndrew Ippolito: of any electrons. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that that. Andrew Ippolito: takes care of that, so this is we call us the two.\nAndrew Ippolito: s orbital so so far, we have one, so we have to us. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now these next three This is where things start to get a little odd.\nAndrew Ippolito: It turns out those parents of electrons so you think about it, this is why they get odd imagine trying to shove, a whole bunch of people into a car.\nAndrew Ippolito: or a boss, think of like a clown car. Andrew Ippolito: So you have this little car and you have 20 people in it Okay, the driver gets in the passenger gets in.\nAndrew Ippolito: The two back occupants get in everybody's sitting like in a completely normal space right, those are spheres, like the one s into us right now, you put a third person in and they're writing in the middle kind of squished in there, a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's it, so the next person that comes in, where are they sitting, maybe, maybe across the feet of the people in the back.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the next person is maybe on top of them. Andrew Ippolito: And then maybe the next person like right you just picture like you're going to start getting increasingly weird contortions of people until you can fit as many people in that space as possible.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's electrons are doing the same thing they have to start getting packed in there, so what we do is.\nAndrew Ippolito: We create these orbitals that start to look a little funky.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this looks like a figure eight, these are called pi orbitals.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they're solid, but they have a note in the middle, so another way to draw them the typical way you draw these is like a figure eight like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: But in reality there's there's nothing in the middle there. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, now I want you to make So if you hold up your pencil like this right imagine that looks like the fig tree right well think about 3D space for a minute we have this plane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then watch me for a second, and we have this plane. Andrew Ippolito: And then we have this play right there's three we live in 3D so we have three planes alright, so you can picture, a figure eight going like this, a sauce to two electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: For. Andrew Ippolito: Six, and so we would say this is X, Y Z, just like the Cartesian coordinates in math right, and so we call these two P X two P y and to peasy.\nEasy peasy. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, you draw like this.\nX y&z. Andrew Ippolito: And then draw a big circle around it and there is your second Shell to 460.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're not going to even do Shell three. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, we can just write that down there's three s.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's three P, why i'm sorry three x three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Three peasy. Andrew Ippolito: And we're not going to do D orbitals and the weirder ones right because, again in biology, these are the ones we generally concern ourselves with.\nAndrew Ippolito: raise your hand, if any, that makes sense. All right, good.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so let's move on. Alexa DePrisco: Yes, just um about the nodes so the nodes occur between the orbitals so like there's like a dozen."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Valence Shells and Reactivity","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the concept of valence shells and how the number of electrons in the outermost shell determines the reactivity of an atom.","start":"41:50","end":"49:45","content":"Andrew Ippolito: All right, so let's move on. Alexa DePrisco: Yes, just um about the nodes so the nodes occur between the orbitals so like there's like a dozen.\nAndrew Ippolito: know that occur between the orbitals and. Alexa DePrisco: orbital itself will have nodes. Andrew Ippolito: So, so the first Shell doesn't have any notes one has doesn't have any knows the second two s has a note in the middle Okay, and then the pie orbitals.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have nodes right in the Center there. Andrew Ippolito: So we're actually draw I can't do this well in 3D space, but the idea, there is there's this gap between the two.\nAndrew Ippolito: The two lobes let's let's call these lobes for lack of a better term again i'm not a chemist but you know the two loaves and then there's a Center in the Center there there's no electron density at all okay.\nAlexa DePrisco: And so. Andrew Ippolito: The electron start. Andrew Ippolito: To get into these more and more exotic dances these are dances they're all trying to balance the love, they have for the nucleus, and the attraction, they have for the nucleus, and the hate they have for all the other electrons around them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right they're. Andrew Ippolito: All in different seat like think about it, if everybody piles into a room. Andrew Ippolito: We all have to find out how we're going to sit right and get into a jam packed audience there's no standard there's no seats left so you're sitting against the back wall or.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right we've all been in those kinds of situations, you get increasingly odd and that's that's, and so what you do there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is you get those increasingly crazy visuals. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we start to talk about how to atoms start to talk to each other and you get those bonds that occur.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can think of. Andrew Ippolito: That.\nAndrew Ippolito: As these three dimensional waves coming together and fusing and the same way, you might picture a lava lamp with bloods coming together Okay, so we like we averaged out those 3D waves and we come up with new ships and that's what you're actually seeing.\nAndrew Ippolito: where's my picture here there that's what you're actually seeing on the beast here so like this is what see this is carbon, this is probably ch four.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we have things, called hybrid.\norbitals. Andrew Ippolito: And that's about as far as we're going to get right now Okay, when we do carbon later.\nAndrew Ippolito: This this all this information i'm teaching you here serves to help you understand carbon when we do organic chemistry so just file this in the back of your head right now all right and that's it for the complexities.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now let's let's go back to simple now so forget orbitals let's just think that let's just limit ourselves to worry about the shells that the electrons are in this, so this is nice and simple the boar model of the atom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which so so bored postulated that electrons are in orbit around the nucleus, in the same way that the planets are in orbit around the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that that was the next you know we went from Dalton saying that there were these things, called Adams and they're invisible.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, in the late 1800s we came up with this idea of the electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the early 1900s we had people trying to figure out how these things are structured and Neil board came up with this notion that the electrons were orbiting in the same way that the earth orbits which was wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it was a more remember sciences replaced by better science so bore replaced Dalton and then you had I think schrodinger and a couple other people postulated this idea of the the orbital model.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the thing with Boris model, though. Andrew Ippolito: Is we can still use it as a useful schematic.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we call these electronic distribution diagrams and that's based on Boars idea Okay, and so these rings these concentric rings each ring represents a shell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the pairs of electrons represent the orbitals right, so you would say, this is a tool that's the one s orbital you don't the where you want to call it, one so that just just think of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: As a pair of electrons right so from that perspective, and this is how you can think for the rest of the Semester with this stuff when when you're thinking about bonding and all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then, Adam has one, two, at most, will be dealing with three Okay, the first shel holtz two electrons one to the second Shell holds 12345678 and the third gel also holds 12345678 of us that would be whatever that noble gases that has 1617 meters are gone I can't remember.\nyeah. Andrew Ippolito: So we can take a tour through the elements now and do this, we can do this here so hydrogen with atomic number one.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's hydrogen. Andrew Ippolito: Right so actually everything i've taught you up to this point, I could just let you sit and stew on it, and you can come up with all of the way everything we act from now on, that you can derive all that all of it from here so watch this here's hydrogen well that's first electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, remember the rule, the rules of the game electrons like the pair right that's an impaired electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: So he's not happy. Andrew Ippolito: So how do we make him happy.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's another hydrogen right next to him what if we bring them together what happens then.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're now they're sharing it. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's what we're going to see i'm not gonna keep going with that, but that's the idea of bonding okay so let's get rid of that so hydrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay lithium i'm sorry i'm sorry helium helium the next one helium would be atomic number two right that's helium So why is helium and noble gas because he's happy those electrons are paired.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so there's a third rule of the game now I can introduce, and that is Adams.\nHow can I put this. Andrew Ippolito: Must.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have. Andrew Ippolito: A full shell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: On their exterior. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, why the exterior that's the part of the atom that experiences, the universe.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the part of the atom at touches things the outermost Shell okay for hydrogen it's the first show.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon it's the second show. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: It doesn't matter what Shell, it is all that matters is what's ever facing out what's ever touching the universe, has to be full.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's two rules there. Andrew Ippolito: The Shell has to be full.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the electrons have to be paired. Andrew Ippolito: In other words, if those rules are not met the atom will react with things until they are.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's the measure of reactivity of an atom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's why helium doesn't react it's it's won the game."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Molecules and Compounds","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the difference between molecules and compounds, highlighting how different ratios of atoms in a molecule can result in different properties.","start":"49:45","end":"54:20","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right that's why helium doesn't react it's it's won the game.\nit's achieve nirvana it is noble now noble noble gas.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call that inert. Andrew Ippolito: write, something that is in nerd means it does not chemically react.\nAndrew Ippolito: The opposite of a nerd will be reactive. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now the fourth rule. Andrew Ippolito: Is once all that's done.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then the atom. Andrew Ippolito: Will.\nAndrew Ippolito: neutralize. Any charge.\nIt has acquired.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so, in other words, if an atom has to lose an electron in order to have an outside Shell that's full as an example lithium, which is the third element.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so if we if we look at the electron configuration of lithium it has atomic number three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay helium is atomic number two I didn't stop number one we look at lithium lithium is got its two electrons and its first Shell and that one is orbital right, but then it needs one more right so we're going to put that third electron out here and it's second shell.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we're at the same problem now right, just like the first hydrogen it's got an impaired electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, listening him does therefore so so think about it, that second Shell can hold a total of eight it has one, so you ask yourself what's easier, is it easier just lose that electron make it go away.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or is it easier to gain seven electrons and, of course, the answer is just lose the one which is exactly what lithium does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so now it's got a full Shell on the outside we're happy, but at what cost.\nAndrew Ippolito: We just lost an electron we're now a plus one charge, because I have now, I have three protons and electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's why lithium after it loses that electron is going to go and it's going to seek some kind of interaction with something that's negative that's why lithium is so reactive.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's going to find something to stick to that's negative and it's going to want an electron is going to share it's going to be attracted to something that's negative.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's go back here now to this exterior Shell back in the old days before we understood what electrons where we have this notion of the strength.\nAndrew Ippolito: That an element had the strength of an element. Andrew Ippolito: That strength of the element was basically what we call it it's measure of reactivity Okay, and so the Greek word for strength is I think it's Valencia, but we can just see violence, so we would say the Valence of carbon that's how we would talk.\nAndrew Ippolito: Once we figured out. Andrew Ippolito: that the reason why elements reacted why Adams reacted was driven purely by this exterior Shell that was that was a special set of electrons we call that Shell, the Valence show and that's where the that's why we call it that, so we call this the veal and show.\nAndrew Ippolito: The Valence Shell is the Shell, that is going to go and react with the world.\nOkay. Any questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so we can just take this little tour here of biologically relevant elements okay there's hydrogen car there's turnips and with chlorine thrown into the mix should not call turnips call chlorine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you know you do not have to memorize these. Andrew Ippolito: It is useful to know some of these it is definitely useful to know carbons configuration and oxygens configuration.\nAndrew Ippolito: it'll probably be good for you to know nitrogen to once you start dealing with organic molecules these guys here are going to control your lives for the next couple of semesters next couple semesters I don't know about that next couple of months.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to be looking at all sorts of organic molecules and the bonds between them, and so it might be helpful to understand how these reality.\nOkay.

Andrew Ippolito: Noble gases right So the question now is well how does an atom get there, how does an atom with pain, the state of nobility How does it's a pain, the state of having a full Valence.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the first example here we're not learning Kobe well first we're going to learn Ionic first, because this makes the most sense we're going to take a pair of atoms.\nAndrew Ippolito: That have a very different electro negativity. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so so basically if you take any two atoms and you look at their electronic activities and you subtract them from each other, so how different are they that's going to determine the kind of bonding that they can.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so if you take. Andrew Ippolito: And if one atom has a much, much stronger or weaker electro negativity difference one Adams going to steal an electron from another they're going to fall on take it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so look at let's look at sodium and chloride alright so sodium has atomic number 11 so here let's let's let's go through this exercise together do this in your notebook this will help you understand this so we're going to look at sodium.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now, oh no, you have to do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: now know you guys are not laughing I just need your focus on your work that's good all right here we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Shell number one so we're thinking in our heads this what you do this is how you do this, you think 11 in your head right atomic number 11 so 1110 987-654-3210 okay so that's the electron configuration of sodium that's how you do.\nAndrew Ippolito: It basically you want to fill the shells the way you learned up to the number of electrons it has.\nAndrew Ippolito: Guy and so notice that sodium has one electron and it's failing show.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you're thinking let's pray going to lose it and and go away it's easier to lose that one that is to gain some sort of chlorine now.\nAndrew Ippolito: and chlorine is atomic number oh boy eating 17 Oh, let me think of my head really quick so 2018 no.\nAlexa DePrisco: Thank you. Andrew Ippolito: Thank you, I just Am I can't go back without destroying this so let's look at Korea 70 alright so again.\nAndrew Ippolito: One two you can also count up from up from zero to get the 17th of 2345 678-910-1112 1314 1516 17 it has seven electrons and it's Valence show.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is it easier to gain one or lose seven, of course, it is easier to gain one oh look sodium has one to give it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you put sodium and chlorine together and they're going to react instantly sodium is going to give up its Valence electron to chlorine chlorine now has a solid Valence Shell, but it will cost.\nAndrew Ippolito: chlorine has an extra electron now, so you would say the chlorine is negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's got a minus one charge to it and sodium has a plus one charge.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, you now have a pair of ions right, you have an anime and the cat I and you put them together, so this year is sodium with this plus one charge.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this here, which is bigger chlorine is bigger than sodium what is minus charge you put those two things together and they're going to be attracted because of their differences in charge, we call this kind of attraction and Ionic bond."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Covalent Bonding","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces covalent bonding and the concept of sharing electrons, focusing on diatomic elements and their bonding patterns.","start":"1:13:51","end":"1:16:27","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And this here, which is bigger chlorine is bigger than sodium what is minus charge you put those two things together and they're going to be attracted because of their differences in charge, we call this kind of attraction and Ionic bond.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: alright. Andrew Ippolito: So that's what you're seeing on the slide right here the slide is everything we just drew now the neat thing is when you look.\nAndrew Ippolito: At the pattern of the three dimensional molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because the chlorine is big and the sodium is small, they fit into these really neat geometrical patterns and the shape of that atomic configuration.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you zoom out into it and you look at the macroscopic continues the pattern that's why salt looks like it does those salt crystals are driven by its atomic configuration.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so a single salted crystal is this cute little cube, and the reason is because the atoms form cubes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Fear go to the museum and you look at those cool crystals and all the different shapes the geometrical to boil she that's because those are more complicated molecules forming a crystal Okay, so a crystal itself as a repeating pattern of molecule.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, I said all that all right, the coviello bond when you have two atoms that have well in this case exactly the same electro negativity nobody wins these tug of wars and so they end up pulling equally on each other and sharing them.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: that's the idea, and so the word itself co Valence there's Valence and co meaning there sure your here's my coworker we work together okay cool Valence.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's three elements. Andrew Ippolito: That we collectively call the diatonic elements.\nAndrew Ippolito: And these are listed below there's hydrogen H2 there's oxygen oh two and there's nitrogen and.\nAndrew Ippolito: In each one of these goes up to form either a single a double or a triple covina.\nAndrew Ippolito: The more the stronger. apes strong together.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so these are the things you're breathing in right now, particularly the oxygen the nitrogen 70% of the air around you is this stuff."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Polarity and Polar Covalent Bonds","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of polarity and polar covalent bonds, highlighting the unequal sharing of electrons and the resulting partial charges.","start":"1:16:27","end":"1:20:20","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so these are the things you're breathing in right now, particularly the oxygen the nitrogen 70% of the air around you is this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's a nerd.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, but that's the idea that's the idea was.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the thing on the right, I got this from the arbitron this is kind of how you can start to understand the hybrid orbital.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you take two orbitals and you mash them together okay now so there's math behind this there's three dimensional math.\nAndrew Ippolito: That defines these three dimensional spaces and when you put two atoms together and you do the math you get a new equation that gives you a new description of the 3D space.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So.\nAndrew Ippolito: These we're going to collectively call non polar bonds when we say non polar we're talking about the idea that everything is shared equally.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so we can build the basic organic molecules so we can start the world of biology here by thinking about carbon so here let's just take methane right now okay so here i'm going to go to the to the blackboard here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to do this let's let's look at carbon the carbon configuration carbon is atomic number six right, and so we have two here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we have another four and here's how you draw those 41234 So the question is how many bonds can carbon form the answer, of course, is for because there's for missing right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So who has one electron well, we can put a hydrogen here, and here, and here, and here, each with its one electron and now everybody's happy and the seat, for which we call method.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the electrode negativity difference between carbon and hydrogen is not significant enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can consider these about the same, and so what what does that mean what's that translate to imagine we had just carbon and hydrogen together so that there's there's a atom of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon and here's an atom of hydrogen. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, you can picture this in the 3D space as a cloud again everything's a cloud of electrons this cloud of electrons is evenly distributed.\nAndrew Ippolito: The electrons are just flowing around that all about the same. Andrew Ippolito: that's what makes it nonpolar okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys still with me this making sense still all right good all right, because now i'm going to teach about water we're just going to skip ahead here every OK OK actually let's let's talk about some.\nAndrew Ippolito: Atomic architecture, so when we when we write it like this, we call this the molecular formula."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Intermolecular Interactions","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses weak intermolecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions.","start":"1:20:20","end":"1:34:43","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Atomic architecture, so when we when we write it like this, we call this the molecular formula.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we draw like this we call this the structural formula.\nAndrew Ippolito: The structural formula gives us more information than the molecular formula, the structural formula starts to show us the bonding so, for example, if you look at esteem down here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, see to each for that's not as informative as looking at this, showing that carbon has a double bond in the middle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the structural formula helps us understand the bonding.\nAndrew Ippolito: The ball and stick model. Andrew Ippolito: Well, now we're adding a three third layer here so compare the structural formula here to the barn stick model here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when you see if the bostic model actually shows you the three dimensional shape okay so here, you can see that carbon forms this three dimensional solid pyramid called a tetrahedron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now there is a hybrid model between these two you might have seen something like this before.\nAndrew Ippolito: You might have seen somebody dropped little triangles.\nlike this. Andrew Ippolito: And then you might sometimes see little slashes that means going back.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is basically the structural formula rendered in a way that's like the bond stick, so you can see 3D space, so if you ever see something like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: That tells you that the curtains coming out of the screen and if you see something that looks.\nAndrew Ippolito: like this, that means it's going back. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, I generally don't dress up like that I usually if i'm doodling things it's like the structural formula.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then the space filling model gives us the most accurate view of what it looks like in real life that's your electron cloud Okay, the problem is with the spaceflight mafia look at St in here that's like less informative than the bond stick model.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's just the most accurate. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so if you were building a model of it to like throw around the room, you would use the ball, the space film model that's what it actually looks like okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now I can teach you about the polar Kobe. Andrew Ippolito: This is arguably the most important bond.\nAndrew Ippolito: Had a ball. Andrew Ippolito: here's how it works. Andrew Ippolito: here's oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: or here let's let's let's build this here's oxygen sorry I don't mean to I when I suddenly do that, I have to get better, I know that jars you out so i'm going to.\nAndrew Ippolito: See i'm going to go to the blackboard now okay So here we go here's oxygens electron configuration oxygen as atomic number eight, so we have two and the first shell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we have six out here. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, this right here that right there is what makes oxygen so special.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is what makes oxygen he to aerobic respiration and it gives it all of its wonderful weird magical properties, the reason is, it has these pairs here what we call loan electron pairs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so oxygen conform to bonds right it's got these two extra electrons that are impaired, and so we can in its simplest steam give a hydrogen to each of these and there's water there's html one of the most abundant compounds in the universe.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, because oxygen loves electron so here you don't have to worry for what i'm going to teach you now I don't it doesn't it's not so important that there's these extra electrons here you don't have to worry about this for the rest of this, I just wanted to point that out for way later.\nAndrew Ippolito: The electrons that float around this molecule let's think of the three dimensional version of this right let's which it looks kind of like Mickey Mouse.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, I want you to picture this as a cloud and understand that the oxygen nucleus likes electrons a lot more than the two hydrogen nuclei.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I want to draw these little dots here those correspond to the nuclei okay so remember the nucleus is positively charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the electron cloud is negatively charged Okay, because the electrons spend more time around oxygen this part of the molecule is ever so slightly it's slightly negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we didn't know that mathematically with a delta a lowercase Delta, with a minus.\nAndrew Ippolito: And because the electron density around the hydrogens is so much weaker, you can picture, have you ever been outside on a cloud partially cloudy day and you've seen you've seen this before so picture now this cloud, and you can kind of see the sun behind it.\nAndrew Ippolito: ever so slightly that's the nucleus of hydrogen shining it's positive light out into the universe beyond the cloud and so it's slightly positive on both of these sites.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it's important to understand, this is not an eye on because if you add up the total number eight let's think of h2o here if we add up the total number of protons here how many protons are there, well, our students got eight and each of the hydrogen has one so that gives us 10 protons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, when we add up the electrons we also get 10, so this is an electrically neutral molecule it's just it's not evenly distributed.\nAndrew Ippolito: This will be like walking into a room of you know 20 people, and most of the people are, on the other side of the room because something smells bad over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's not evenly distributed, and so we call this polarity and we see, this is a polar Kobe bond.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so you could also draw like this, you can think of it as having.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like a magnet. Andrew Ippolito: A dipole moment, if you know what that means don't worry about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so with So there you go that's. Andrew Ippolito: It can see your slightly negative charge your slightly positive charge.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the idea here is that the electro negativity between the two is buried, I went to this really isn't a see it's different the electro negativity difference.\nAndrew Ippolito: is significant, but not so much that you lead to an Ionic bond Okay, and so really you the the College level version of this and you're going to have to notice in your chemistry class anyway, if you think about a purely non polar Kobe bond and a purely Ionic bond.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is a spectrum here of bonding so technically the carbon hydrogen bond.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a little bit more polar than a carbon carbon bond or a hydrogen hydrogen bonds oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: So it'll be like here on the spectrum.\nAndrew Ippolito: So. Andrew Ippolito: What the spectrum here is is it's the differences and electronic activities if there's no difference at all, you have a truly non political band bond if the difference is some particular like infinity let's say.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's going to be Ionic Okay, and so, when you take your chemistry class you're going to learn there's some threshold that you can that's i'm just making this up right now, I have no idea what it actually is let's see it's 4.7 when you take the two different.\nAndrew Ippolito: Electronic activities you add them together or subtract them from each other, you get a number if the number falls on this side of the threshold we call that a Kobe on the bond, and if it's on this side of the threshold we call it Ionic bond.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so bonding in chemistry is a spectrum.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now week chemical interactions are when you have molecules actually I just looked at the time, for they want to see how much time we have it's 1211 okay so we're okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: um. Andrew Ippolito: Oh yeah So here we don't worry about Lewis structures in this class but that's the what the Lewis structure would be essentially we just showing the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Valence electrons right, so this will be the Lewis structure of oxygen you know hydrogen would have this, and so the picture them like like puzzle pieces that's what the Lewis structure lets you do lets you think about the bonding a little bit easier okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so there you go. Andrew Ippolito: A week chemical interaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can think of as an intra molecular.\nbond. Andrew Ippolito: or bonding so everything we just learned was intra molecular i'm sorry i'm sorry I have that backwards.\nAndrew Ippolito: into is within an intra molecular bond would be the colby on bond and the Ionic bonds okay and inter molecular.\nAndrew Ippolito: would be when we have two molecules like see, this is a molecule of water, and this is a molecule of water and we're talking about bonding between those okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are necessarily going to be weaker than the intra molecular bonds, because if they weren't we just have a bigger molecule right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the idea is is molecules are distinct in this case, and they have weak interactions between them.\nOkay, so they're easily reversible. Sorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: The most common of them is called the hydrogen bond, this is a bond that's formed between the slightly negative and the slightly positive regions of the molecule So if you look at this water molecule here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see that the hydrogen, which is slightly positive is interacting with the nitrogen in ammonia Okay, so we didn't talk about this yet, but nitrogen like oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: has an electro negativity that's significant and so nitrogen forming it's difficult so nitrogen version of water, the default state with hydrogens is ammonia, and this is an H3.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and the nitrogen is like oxygen slightly negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the slight negative and the slight positive just tug on each other, a little bit like a week velcro.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that interaction right there we call the hydrogen bomb. Andrew Ippolito: And we find these we're going to see these everywhere.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So this is a bunch of water molecules bopping around.\nAndrew Ippolito: In a liquid, and you can see, the little dots everywhere, representing the hydrogen bonds, so if this was a video, and we were playing it, and this was like room temperature water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those watermark is will be moving fast enough, but their own intrinsic energy to not get stuck in place in any one area Okay, so these bonds would be constantly being made and broken.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so here i'm going to put this image in your head, right now, this will help us with pH leader imagine water Okay, every time it sees each other they're high five each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's what's happening here those little high fives you have to stop and are there, a little handshakes very quick handshakes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, imagine walking through a room, you have to shake everybody's hand to get through it oh hi hi how are you hi how are you everybody taking everybody else's hands it's just so they're all everybody's just stuck together a little bit that's a group of water molecules okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, Vander walls interactions you might have seen in your chemistry class something called London.\nAndrew Ippolito: dispersion or London dispersion forces Okay, this is described up here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the idea is very, very simple, if you take just two atoms that are electrically neutral that sorry that are not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anything special so like here's the atom and here's another atom right so those just they have their electron cloud they got their nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you start pushing them together and you force them to get close together just by pressure just get them close together what's going to happen is this nucleus here will be ever so slightly attracted to this electron cloud.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and this nucleus here will not like this nucleus and they're going to push each other away and so when they get really close together about five nanometers.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see that this one of the nuclei starts to push outside of its shell a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: and attract the other cloud towards it just a little bit. Andrew Ippolito: and push this nucleus away right so that's a picture, this is a magnet repelling each other, you push these two things together this man is going to push this magnet apart and so it's going to move it over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so this is going to move this way and, as a result, the electron cloud is going to descend and kind of come this way, and you get a slight attraction, even though there's no polarity.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is called the London dispersion for us, my understanding of it is okay, when I was your age and we learned about this and biology and chemistry we call these bandra walls forces, but apparently that's Vander Waal interactions are the generic term and the include hydrogen bombs okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: The gecko This is how the gecko sticks to glass. Andrew Ippolito: Is through these so you just need a whole lot of interaction, at the same time that's why it's fully shaped like that form and function there's another example of form, following function.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason why the get go foot has all of those if you if you looked at the skin of this so i'm going to go to the blackboard here, instead of like."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 2 (Part 2) - General Chemistry","link":"https://youtu.be/nh-CCxIKEdU?si=Vy9qIrz9r7rF_mtm","chunkTitle":"Hybrid Orbitals","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces hybrid orbitals and their role in determining molecular shape, focusing on SP3 and SP2 hybridization.","start":"1:34:43","end":"1:37:36","content":"Andrew Ippolito: The reason why the get go foot has all of those if you if you looked at the skin of this so i'm going to go to the blackboard here, instead of like.\nAndrew Ippolito: The bottom of the foot being like flat it has all of these surface area convolutions to maximize the amount of sticking to the glass Okay, this is probably why we have fingerprints right think about the fact that this is a very slick piece of ceramic grade.\nAndrew Ippolito: But I can hold this and if I put my finger on this it's it doesn't move that much you can do this right now with anything that's shiny and smooth piece of glass, we probably use a little bit of this here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe we don't but it's fun to think about.

Andrew Ippolito: Well, where does this even come from think of pure carbon, if we look at carbons electron configuration it looks kind of like this just carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but when we look at the shape of ch for.\nAndrew Ippolito: It has the tetrahedral shapes. Andrew Ippolito: So, in other words, when when the hydrogen is come in here and attack this stuff it changes the shape of the electron clouds and the way you think of that is taking the hydrogen orbitals and taking the carbon orbitals.\nAndrew Ippolito: And averaging them all out to a new sheet. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and what happens is is the S orbital i'm going to blank this now, the S orbital.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the p orbital. Andrew Ippolito: And up mathematically mushing together to form what's called a hybrid s P orbital which kind of looks like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: like an exclamation mark I guess okay and there's SP to hybrid orbitals which means you're using two of the pie orbitals and there's SP three pi orbitals would use all three of them Okay, the SP three orbitals give us the tetrahedron of carpet the 3D shape.\nAndrew Ippolito: The SP to orbitals or what helps us understand these double bonds that formal plane.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's where you'll get so i'm going to blank this out now that's where you get.

Okay, these are descriptions of the behavior of molecules and their relationship with water, so any molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: That can experience of bonding with water through is hydrogen bonding we would consider that hydrophobic alright so there's two routes here fellows empath those filmic means love path, which means fear right, so we go to the Philharmonic right Philharmonic Orchestra, the love of music.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't go to the harmonic.\nAndrew Ippolito: which I suppose, would be a small insulated room and which sound cannot come in around.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because you fear sound right we live in a near the city of Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, which many people construe as an ironic name.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't have a city called Philadelphia city of brotherly fear, nobody trusts each other, are you okay so that's the idea so hydrophobic are molecules that do not experience and interaction with water.\nAnd there's consequences to

consequences to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there are many molecules that do interact with water and we'll call that how you're feeling okay so that's that you don't have to worry you don't have to memorize the 104.5 degree bond angle between the oxygen.\nUnless you want to keep that as one of your fun facts that you impress your friends with you don't have to ever know that for me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so what we're going to do right now is we're going to go through the physical properties of water, what makes what are special and then we're going to talk about the chemical properties pH so cohesion is another vocabulary word, which means when any time.\nAndrew Ippolito: The molecules of a given compound interact with each other so it's within so a water molecule interacting with watermark and we call that cohesion Okay, so you would say waters cohesive.\nAndrew Ippolito: With this does is lead to a high surface tension okay so surface tension is a property of liquids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it is a measure of how much resistance can be.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a measure of how much force is required to break the surface and to get into it right so picture three well here, you can see the paperclip floating on the glass right or some kind of water bug jumping or long on the palm.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this also explains, if you take you know, like after after you wax your car.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or if you ever go and you look at flowers after the rain you'll notice that the water beats up on the flowers in a very pretty way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those beads of water are driven by the balance between so for this be here the surface is hydrophobic it does not interact with water.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the water interacts with itself and so that combination gives you the beating.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so flowers have a waxy surface that's hydrophobic, and so the water pools, whereas if you don't have a car that's freshly waxed the water just kind of speeches out on it right it doesn't beat because it's not hydrophobic necessarily.\nOkay."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 1) - The Chemistry Of Water | pH and

can dissolve anything that's hydrophobic and many things are hydrophobic so many things.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you can see, like the beat of water beating on a leaf, in this case that's actually tree SAP on a friend plan that I took a picture of many years ago.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it just sat there it didn't evaporate because it was SAP, which is very hydrophobic and doesn't interact with it

Space unusual and that the solid version of water is less dense than the liquid version of water most solids are denser than their liquid counterparts, but not so water and here's why.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here i'm going to go to the black screen for a second, and I want you to picture a water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just just a glass of water, and I want you to picture the water molecules in them themselves they're doing this, like my hands are always juggling.\nAndrew Ippolito: everything's always juggling remember Okay, and it was hot What that means is they're juggling fast and if it's cold, that means they're juggling slow.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I want you to picture fast juggling water molecules are fast enough where any to watermark is bumping into each other or fast enough where they don't get stuck together.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like running through a crowd high five in them on they want to shake your hands, no time clap clap clap clap right so now slow them down.\nAndrew Ippolito: slower and slower and slower and eventually you reach a threshold, where the hydrogen bonds become the dominant force in the system and when that happens, you get this magical arrangement all the water molecule start falling in line and forming these beautiful hexagonal patterns.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because of the shape of the water molecule So you can see here you zoom in a little bit here you zoom in here, you can see that so here's the hexagon have one more notice that every other one has its hydrogens inverted.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so the top of this, one you'll see has a hydrogen sticking up and the bottom of this one has an oxygen sticking down, and so they connect to each other through hydrogen bonds and they form these beautiful patterns, this is the crystal of water.\nAndrew Ippolito: notice that the inside of the hexagon is empty space.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's not dense and so a single cluster of these will be less dense than as you look at liquid water or all the molecules are clustered together it's more dense okay so that's why ice floats on top of your liquid water.\nAndrew Ippolito: And because of this fact.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so why is this

chemistry thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't want you to be able to read these and understand it it's on the bottom here you got temperature going on.\nAndrew Ippolito: And on the side here you have a measure of energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: How much energy are we putting into the system and the unit of energy we use is generally the calorie.\nAndrew Ippolito: A calorie is equal to the amount of heat or the amount of energy, it takes to raise one gram of pure water one degree Celsius.\nAndrew Ippolito: So Imagine you had a block of ice.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you put it in a pot, and you put the pot on the stove and you turn the stove on, and so you have this constant influx of heat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's that's the game you're playing in your head you're warming up this big ice, but now I mentioned that I spoke at a thermometer in it embedded in it and you read it, and it says zero degrees because it's frozen.\nOkay Celsius.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excuse me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sorry alright, so we start adding calories of heat to the system.\nAndrew Ippolito: One more time so let's do some more.\nAndrew Ippolito: water.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So much there we go, so what we're doing is we're playing this game that we're watching a movie of water heating up, and so we would see.\nAndrew Ippolito: As we start increasing the temperature let's say it's in minus 40 degrees, it says minus three degrees minus two degrees minus one degrees and then it says zero degrees right now you're heating this thing but it's still solid.\nAndrew Ippolito: You need to pump another 80 calories into that ice Program.\nAndrew Ippolito: To change it to a liquid.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that So you see this here.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the amount of energy, it takes to take one gram of water and convert it from zero degrees solid to zero degree liquid.\nAndrew Ippolito: All we're doing at that point is collapsing, the crystal structure we're going to go back a slide here what we're doing is we're we're making these things move fast enough so they start breaking apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're not making them vibrate faster, and therefore the temperatures not going to change we're changing their layout or changing their entropy.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you really want to get down to the nitty gritty of this we're giving them more freedom more degrees of freedom more chaos or going from a solid liquid.\nAndrew Ippolito: or not increasing the temperature remember that whole H equals.\nAndrew Ippolito: What are we G minus.\nAndrew Ippolito: T s that's we're going to learn this later in the Semester, this is the total amount of energy in the system is equal to.\nAndrew Ippolito: The amount of useful energy minus the temperature and entropy so temperature and entropy we're actually getting to see this here.\nAndrew Ippolito: temperature is the whole everything's juggling the more juggling, the higher the temperature entropy as a measure of how structured things are so we're going from a low entropy state here.\nAndrew Ippolito: To a higher entropy state here we're increasing that s we're not changing the tea at that moment and that's why in this diagram right here, this is solid, this is this is going up it's not the temperature is not changing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Despite the fact that we're putting more energy into it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then what happens between here, and here is that very satisfying you're watching the water boil and get hotter and hotter you see the steam coming off of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then the temperature goes up you see 20 degrees 25 degrees 30 degrees 40 degrees 50 degrees 90 degrees 99 degrees 100 degrees and you're like now it's gonna boil and I could start eating soon and it doesn't boil.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's going on here, why does it take so long for the water to boil it turns out that because water has all those hydrogen bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Look at this jump look at this huge line going up here one gram of water takes 540 calories of energy to make it go from 100 degree liquid to 100 degree vapor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that property of water week, so we call this the specific heat of a compound specific heat is the amount of energy, it takes.\nTo change it state.\nAndrew Ippolito: I should say specific heat is a measure of how much energy it can it can hold.\nAndrew Ippolito: As opposed to the amount of energy has to give back to the environment has anybody here ever you know, think of a cookie sheet made of aluminum.\nAndrew Ippolito: or think of aluminum foil you put aluminum in the oven before hundred degrees you take it out and it's cold like very quickly, you can touch it why because the aluminum has a very low specific key it gives you it gives the heat back just as fast as it takes it.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is also why the deserts cold at night right during the day in the desert the sun shining down and it's really hot and it hits the silica in the.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the sand and so it has a very low specific key, and so the sand reflects the heat right back at you, and so you're getting hit with to wait two heats.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why in the desert people were those very long robes the ideas that creates a convection currents like a fan, because the heats coming back from the sand so much what happens when the sun goes down.\nAndrew Ippolito: It gets really cold, because nothing trapped the heat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, water is very different, if you live by the coast, the reason why the temperature doesn't change too much is because the water holds all this energy and just slowly gives it back.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is also why your French Fries stay so hot they bring your mouth after you start to wait for him to cool down they take forever to cool down if you've ever eaten a baked potato or French Fries or mashed potatoes when they were really hot.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you waited what you thought was a reasonable amount of time before sticking it in your mouth and then you're like God damn it you still bring your tongue.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's because of the same property of water okay hi specific eat.\nVictoria Bloemker: After.\nAndrew Ippolito: Eight Oh, the h's and that's an nlp sorry.\nVictoria Bloemker: that's the total he writing the whole thing again."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 1) - The Chemistry Of Water | pH and Buffers","link":"https://youtu.be/Mwd05SQBuUg?si=ZvmUvdxrtCtUiTFe","chunkTitle":"Phase Changes and Solutions","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains phase changes in water and introduces the concept of solutions.","start":"15:02","end":"24:59","content":"Victoria Bloemker: that's the total he writing the whole thing again.\nAndrew Ippolito: I know, like the total yeah yeah and and i'm sorry i'm giving this to really early in the Semester it's H equals G minus T, so this is something we learned in Chapter seven or eight is when we do thermodynamics.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's just it crops up here in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is the free energy of this system, this is the temperature of the system, this is the entropy of the system, and this is the total amount of energy of the system so basically any system.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you look at all the energy it has you can roughly divided into the useful energy we call G and the useless energy we call the temperature and the entropy.\nAndrew Ippolito: We just say Ts and so in this diagram or watching the temperature go up and then it stops going up why, if we were able to look at this in 3D and the Z axis was entropy we will watch that change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually, should that be a cool thing to look at someday might do it right so that's the entropy changing.\nAndrew Ippolito: The amount of order in the system, the order is collapsing, the crystals are going from solid liquid or going from fewer degrees of freedom to many degrees of freedom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, when I when I mean by that if I go back to slide is if I look at any given watermark could hear that watermark is constrained it's locked in place it can't move.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then it collapses, and now can move anywhere.\nAngela Harbeck: you've given it more freedom because.\nAngela Harbeck: Does it take a lot of energy to turn into ice.\nAndrew Ippolito: So going back and forward always uses the same amount of energy, all this is reversible so it will take you would have to remove.\nAndrew Ippolito: 80 calories of heat from zero degree liquid water in order to get it to be zero degree ice okay good good great question, I never thought of it that way.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, but so here here's the thing so imagine one gram of water.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're at 27 degrees you add one calorie now you're 28 you had one calorie or 29 you had one carrier 30 your one calorie 99 01 carried 102 calories at 130 calories that 100 you have to go all the way to 540 before you start to see turn into beeper.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is why we can, this is why we sweat, this is why humans have adapted a very special kind of sweat on our body our sweat is different than most other animals horses sweat but horse what isn't like our sweat.\nAndrew Ippolito: We adapted to run far we can shed heat like no other animal.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why our bodies are shaped the way they are, and that's why we have all these sweat pores so here's what happens ready i'm going to go to the blackboard here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the surface of your arm Okay, and you start running the temperature in your body goes up right, how do we call down where's this negative feedback come from.\nAndrew Ippolito: What we do is we throw some salt up here and water follow salt will learn about us Moses later, and then we get some liquid water on the surface of our skin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the air hot hot water right because we're hot the air then pulls the heat away and it keeps going and, once this evaporates it takes away with it, that 540 calories per gram.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you are very, very efficient at cooling down you're pulling that heat away from your body now it's important to realize when we say calorie here we're talking about a real calorie not a capital calorie, which is a food calorie.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is 1000 calories okay so or kill a cow.\nVictoria Bloemker: Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason is, and when you look at the back of your cereal box and it says there's 100 calories right imagine that said 100,000 calories you think oh i'm not eating that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so food calories are actually kilocalories.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is 540 lowercase calories.\nAndrew Ippolito: or Point five calories.\nWould you say.\nVictoria Bloemker: Right, did I hear somebody say something sorry my.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh there vicki tori.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah my came.\nVictoria Bloemker: To me and i'm like oh my God you're so cute.\nSorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right so that's that.\nAlexa DePrisco: Before you move on, just like about like any other sweating animal do we all have different sweat then, because I know you were different resources, but like what about like because it's saying apes and monkeys and Hippo sweat too.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh yes, they sweat and I don't know how different their sweat is that's a great question there so it's probably the same as theirs, if I had to guess the differences there there Harry.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so they're going to get they're going to overheat fast and they can't run fast, because they they're not the walkers whereas we're bipedal.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when you walk on your knuckle week so here's one little fun thing about our bodies, if you think about your hips.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you think about your think of remember the old GI Joe action figures from like the 1980s and 90s.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, you have the the way the legs go into the socket so you have this joint right here Okay, if you think about it, you stand up, think about where your bone inserts into your body it's not 90 degrees it's not like a row like if you were designing a robot.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if you were designing a robot that walked up right, you would put them, you would put the legs right there okay hours or is it think about where your hip socket is it's rotated forward and down.\nAndrew Ippolito: optimized for knuckle walking.\nAndrew Ippolito: While we're so we're we're not optimized for naca walking but it shows that we used to be Naka walkers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because if we weren't ever knuckle walkers the base of our hip would be 90 degrees from the surface of the gravity we lean forward a little bit and actually remember atavism I did it.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talked about out of this decrease the idea of the snake, with the leg okay there's this family in Europe that has this weird atavistic trees, the whole family genetically related and they can't walk upright.\nAndrew Ippolito: They only walk on their knuckles you could go Google this there's a whole documentary on them.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we run and we shed okay so other animals some some so think of your dog and your cat they don't sweat the pant.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what your dogs always panting when he's hot, the only place, they have the shed their heaters are mousehole they can't shit hit throughout their whole body.\nAndrew Ippolito: shot your pile.\nApril Neeld: Actually dogs sweat on their cause and their tongue that's like how they.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's right that's right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, yes, yes that's Nessa new.\nAndrew Ippolito: fact that I forgot about I.\nApril Neeld: just learned that recently too thanks for reminding me.\nAndrew Ippolito: But they don't have sweat pouring out their whole body and so they're much less efficient than us and what was it their their paws are what.\nApril Neeld: They do their paws and on their tongue.\nAndrew Ippolito: tongue that's right.\nApril Neeld: So that's why, when they're really nervous and rolling a lot.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right.\nApril Neeld: that's kind of gross sweating off your tongue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so if we didn't have hydrogen bonds and water, the freezing point would be minus 100 degrees let's just think of the spectrum of temperature right now here's your degrees.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's 100 degrees here's minus 100 degrees so normal water this Celsius Celsius scale normal water freezes here and it boils here there's 100 degrees of range there where we have a liquid right without the hydrogen bonds, the freezing point would be here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the boiling point would be here.\nAndrew Ippolito: tiny little window of nine degrees.\nAndrew Ippolito: China Chinese kristin what CRM what Chinese Kristen what birds dogs.\nApril Neeld: Okay it's a hairless temperate dog.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh i'm learning all sort of thank.\nAndrew Ippolito: I love learning new stuff and I very rarely get to learn genuinely new things that I get to like keep forever in my head i'm never gonna forget that Chinese kristin dogs, I have to look that up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but you see this now, so we have this little sliver of liquid now, in other words, earth would be this barren dry dust bowl.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we would not have any life on probably Okay, so this property of water is what gives us the ability to have normal life as we understand it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and woman and I have remaining i'm just going to introduce this concept of solutions to you a solution is when you have a combination of some liquid and then some.\nAndrew Ippolito: Otherwise, would be solid that is interacting with the liquid, and therefore we would call dissolved Okay, and so, for most of life we're talking about what we would call an aqueous solution or solution with water in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and so the saw you to particle would be the substance that is dissolved in the solvent, which is the water in this case Okay, and we call the differences phases, so we would say the the liquid fees and the side or the solvent fees and the side face.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when we meet when we reconvene on Monday we'll finish up.\nThis stuff will do pH and then we'll do.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's next carbon organic chemistry all finished that too okay.\nApril Neeld: All right, so i'm gonna stop the recording right now, what is the quiz gonna be on live up to."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 2)

Andrew Ippolito: i'm back here we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: And let's talk about water so when we left last left off with water, our old friend water that give her up life.\nAndrew Ippolito: We were talking about a reality, where water didn't have this hydrogen bonds holding it together, and if that was the case.\nAndrew Ippolito: The range of temperature over which water would remain liquid very quickly now we're down to a nine degree little tiny little region and that most of the water on earth would be a vpn.\nAndrew Ippolito: So these hydrogen bonds are really the, the key to everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's that's the basic physical properties of water itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now let's talk about a related topic solutions at the end of the day, a cell and biology is a solution really it's a it's a mixture of things it's mostly solution but there's also a couple other things thrown in there, so it's best to understand the relationship between."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 2) - The Chemistry Of Water | pH and Buffers","link":"https://youtu.be/jCq-wjPqxm0?si=kqp69EXf6D3l38_l","chunkTitle":"Types of Solutions","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the different types of solutions: solutions, colloidal dispersions, and suspensions.","start":"2:00","end":"6:29","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Water and the things that can go inside the water to dissolve in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so we have this thing called a solution. Andrew Ippolito: A solution by definition has two phases to it it's got a liquid fees and it has I guess you call it a solid fee is the solvent would be the liquid fees and the Salyut would be the solid fees.\nAndrew Ippolito: And because we're dealing with water, as the softened really the call it the universal solvent we're going to talk about aqueous solution okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's talk about something called dissolve let's use the let's let's define this word here dissolve as opposed to another word will also use dissociate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you can think of this is physical. And this has come and gone.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, when something dissolves and water that's a very generic term it just means that that thing let's call it X is surrounded by water molecules that's all it means got a skin of water on it, and the reason why I can do that is because that thing is either a polar or it charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: In other words, it can experience and interaction with water and contrast, something that associates breaks.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so that would be like the sodium chloride coming in and falling apart into the chloride and sodium ions okay so dissociate is the word, this is a very specific word, this means to break apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: chemically. Andrew Ippolito: So we'll talk about glucose dissolving and water, but I want to associate glucose is still glucose in the water.\nAndrew Ippolito: hydrochloric acid, so I didn't hydroxide sodium chloride these things dissociated water okay their chemistry changes.\nAndrew Ippolito: make sense. Andrew Ippolito: Good alright so that's that's the difference there, so when we talk about solutions we're talking about things that do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so let's say that dissociate is a specific kind of dissolving again dissolve is a generic word that just means it's surrounded by water, so I, it is appropriate to say salt dissolves in water.\nAndrew Ippolito: It is equally appropriate to say salt dissociate some water, it is appropriate to say glucose or sugars dissolve in water, it is not appropriate to say glucose to associate some water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're going to say here that a solution is something that has dissolved in the water, whether it's dissociated or not okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: A colloidal dispersion or just a cold Lloyd, otherwise known as an emotion.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is let's picture those saw you particles is bigger now okay that's the key here, the thing that's in the water is bigger.\nAndrew Ippolito: and colleagues tend to be cloudy. Andrew Ippolito: But like a solution if you just leave them alone, they will stay that way they're equal their equilibrium is this evenly distributed.\nAndrew Ippolito: system. Andrew Ippolito: Think khomeini's. Andrew Ippolito: ice cream.\nAndrew Ippolito: The food in your stomach from breakfast Okay, but also extracellular fluid intracellular fluid so inside your cell, you also have this it's not your cell isn't just a solution that's also a colored okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, maybe gel like. alright.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's the code. Andrew Ippolito: And then I suspension is when you got even bigger things.\nAndrew Ippolito: I hear some money Python the Holy Grail they talked about small rocks floating in the water and falls down to the bottom, that that's a suspension your blood is a suspension right the red blood cells in your blood will settle over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: yeah snow Globe think of a snow globe, if you have a snow Globe on your shelf shake that up and watch the snowfall slowly and i'm he falls down to the bottom, the suspension okay so that's it there's solutions colds and suspensions.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they're all three of them are now this picture might be a little confusing Okay, so you got a B and then see."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 2) - The Chemistry Of Water | pH and Buffers","link":"https://youtu.be/jCq-wjPqxm0?si=kqp69EXf6D3l38_l","chunkTitle":"Why Do We Use Salt on Roads?","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the use of salt on roads in winter and the concept of freezing point depression.","start":"6:30","end":"9:30","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And the reason why you need to pictures of see is because the suspension settle over time, and so you need a before and after that right, so you can see here the solution, this might be, you know food coloring and water, this might literally be man is not sure.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, this is your blood, just after it's drawn, and this is blood after its draw after some time has passed and you can see it separates out between the plasma and the what they'd say the hematocrit.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is just a fancy word for the red blood cells and then actually in between them you'll see this tiny little white thing that's called the buffy later and that's where all your White blood cells are.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right. Alexa DePrisco: So. Andrew Ippolito: yeah go ahead. Alexa DePrisco: What would milk, be considered.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Both for co located on a solution, I would say. Alexa DePrisco: Because it has proteins in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it also has sugars dissolved in, and so I would say it's both it's milk it's a third it's a fourth thing there's milk let's let's add a milk column here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, so the key that's a great question because it does speak to the fact that. Andrew Ippolito: Sometimes you have things that are both I mean think of blood bloods a little ball that too right, you have sugar in your blood you got protein in your blood you got red blood cells in your blood so bloods all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so don't look at these as systems, look at these as states have a system that can overlap right.\nalright. Alexa DePrisco: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so what I want you guys to do now.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know what I would do on class I usually turn to your neighbor we can't do that you know and i'm not going to sit here and do breakout groups that's going to take like an hour to figure out.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what we're gonna do is you're just going to think to yourself and talk out loud, this is think of it as a class i'm not going to talk, because I know the answer to this.\nAndrew Ippolito: But what I want you to try to figure out is, why do we throw salt on the road in the wintertime like right now, why does it why that's putting salt down.\nAndrew Ippolito: And and really as a follow up question is why shouldn't you in certain place like I don't start my driveway at all we ship it and i'll explain why in a bit, but go ahead, think about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody have an idea. Zachary Lucas: isn't it because, like the freezing point depression.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh excellent okay so zach was saying that. Andrew Ippolito: It causes a. Andrew Ippolito: But you see a decrease or lowering.\nZachary Lucas: This is like resolving depression. Andrew Ippolito: The freezing freezing point depression right.\nZachary Lucas: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So the idea is we're not heating it up that's what like most people think they throw the salt on in there and.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it heats up, and I think some people think that because there was there are those little packets, you can buy you know, like when you go skiing or out in the snow you crack a minute there they get hot.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I feel like they're filled with salt, maybe that's that's has nothing to do with this.\nAndrew Ippolito: What salt does here so first of all look at look at this slide there's your sodium Ion right, so you would say this dissociated on water."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 2) - The Chemistry Of Water | pH and Buffers","link":"https://youtu.be/jCq-wjPqxm0?si=kqp69EXf6D3l38_l","chunkTitle":"Understanding pH","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of pH and its relationship to the concentration of hydrogen ions in water.","start":"9:31","end":"26:56","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Right and look at the water around it, you can see that the hydrogens i'm sorry that the oxygens are surrounding it, because the oxygen they're slightly negative right, and so the sodium positive and then over here to the chloride, you can see that the hydrogen surrounding it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when you put all this together, you can see that you kind of form this matrix of sodium chloride interfering with the water crystals.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK so. Andrew Ippolito: The water has to get even colder before it will be willing to crystallize because the sodium and chloride ions are disrupting it okay so basically any any solution of water that has stuff in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whether it's sodium or glucose or so anything any ions in there is going to have a lower freezing point, this is why the ocean doesn't freeze over, but the freshwater lake next to it would.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: This is why, when the when the ocean does freeze, you know it's cold.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So i'll introduce a little topic here i'm just going to touch this awesome Moses, the idea of so in order to understand as Moses later.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's helpful to understand that there's two kinds of water here there's water that's bound to whatever dissolved in in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like these water molecules here's the other they're bound to the sodium they're not free to move around they're stuck there's like little sponges and then there's other water molecules that are bound to them.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and so we're going to see the US Moses, has to do when you have two solutions that have different amount of stuff in them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they're separated by a boundary of where the water is allowed to go past, but nothing else is, you are going to see the water flow downhill and that's that's Moses.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, or you can also see on the right here, this is why waters able to easily dissolve sodium chloride, you can see these little water molecules here, these are the relative sizes to chloride, which is the big blue ball.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so these little watermark up to get into the cracks and attack it and pull it apart very gently.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay alright So here we are we're now going to start to understand what peaches peaches all about water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Understanding pH is really understanding of water so here's the thing when we look at a water molecule under normal circumstances, it will occasionally spontaneously all by itself, because it's just everything's bopping around all the time.\nAndrew Ippolito: It will dissociate. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now in reality what's happening this, this is the chemical reaction, I mean this is the the way the equation is setup but what I want you to do is look at it, in reality, I want you to see water.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is what really goes on, if this is a water molecule, and this is another water molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's this week hydrogen bonding between them right right here. Andrew Ippolito: Between that hydrogen and oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Normally they'll just kind of stick together so little bits this is kind of like a handshake Okay, but every once in a while.\nAndrew Ippolito: Water becomes a wiki like chewbacca and droids you know how wikis anybody here know the Star Wars reference what what are wikis do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Nobody nobody here know Star Wars enough to tell me what it will keep us.\nJordan Russell: All I can think about is just chewbacca screaming. Andrew Ippolito: Okay yeah he does do that a lot he rips.\nJordan Russell: Arms off. Andrew Ippolito: They rip arms off that's honey yeah never, never.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let the wiki when. Andrew Ippolito: Right we've all probably remember that phrase that's because they'll rip your arms off if.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's right that's right when see three pieces why aren't why isn't anybody afraid of losing to a droid and Han solo says, because drives don't rip your arms off.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so what what does it have to do, water will occasionally rip itself apart, so, in other words, this water molecule here will rip this hydrogen off here so it'll do this here i'm going to skip ahead to a here, this is what's going on.\nAndrew Ippolito: There it is. Andrew Ippolito: Right I should put that in the first page you see that, so the watermelon comes along and instead of just having a nice little happy hydrogen bond and bouncing along it rips off the other hydrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so what does that do that causes this temporary state of the water Okay, so if I was able to pause that which I cannot but, so let me get out of here now go back to this point here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I already I already taught you that I should we can get off the slide now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here we just stay here, so this thing here on the left hand side when this happens, we get this plain old oxygen when the hydrogen attached to it, but it has a pair of extra electrons all right, Christopher what's ripped off here is literally just the proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, as a result, this thing here is negative one, this is called the hydroxide ions.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then on the right hand side we have this proton but really the proton is bound to a water molecule kind of like how we went through ammonium earlier today, this is called the hydro niamh Ion.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is the important thing, this is the reactive thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, just as fast as this happens in pure water this Hydra owning Am I on interacts with the hydroxide iron and brings brings us back to just having a pair of water molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is how you would actually draw her right at eight to each two o's reversible give us two hydroxide i'm sorry one hydroxide negative plus H three helpless and there you go.\nAndrew Ippolito: So if we think of this is a steady state. Andrew Ippolito: Or, this goes back and forth and oscillates what I want you to think now is let's let's say in a liter of water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we have a graduated cylinder here and we have one leader of pure water.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, we have three things in there. Andrew Ippolito: We have h2o we have O H minus we have pH plus which really is each three plus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, these are the three different species of molecule that are in that water, and so the question is.\nAndrew Ippolito: is how much of it is in there. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is where we measure things in moles because we don't care how big these things are we just care about how many there physically are so how many molecules of water.\nAndrew Ippolito: How many molecules of hydro niamh and how many molecules of hydroxide so we're going to measure things and the number of moles in a leader and that's what modularity does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: We don't traditionally think about water having a mother and concentration, but does and here's why pure water pure water.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a little bit I didn't put a plus charge here sorry there's a little bit of all this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what determines this in pure water what determines, this is just the physics of water itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the only way we can calculate this rather, the only way we can learn this is to measure it, so this is an empirical observation of water, this is just water and out in the wild and it turns out, when we measure.\nAndrew Ippolito: This in pure water this number of hydrogen ions we get a number of one times 10 to the negative seventh moles per liter.\nAndrew Ippolito: which corresponds to point 1234567 miles per liter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that this number right here, this is just the amount of hydrogen ions and a pure liter of water per liter of pure water.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Now, if I add something to that water.\nI guess make it a solution. Andrew Ippolito: And what I add to the water changes that concentration.\nAndrew Ippolito: For example, if I add something like hcl to it, which is an Ionic compound called hydrochloric acid what's going to happen when I add the hydrochloric acid into the water is like sodium chloride, for the same reasons it's going to dissociate completely into chloride ions in and protons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what happens immediately is this each plus interacts with a water molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because that's mostly what's there and what's that going to create more of these hydro nehemiah.\nAndrew Ippolito: and other words my concentration of hydrogen ions is going to shoot up.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's what I want you to do in terms of understand the math behind this take this number over here on the right, this one times 10 to the negative Seventh and make it 10 times bigger.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what would you write, I want to make sure you understand decimals and exponents, and all this like negative exponents, how do you make this bigger in scientific notation make it 10 times bigger give me an answer.\ntakeaway zero. Andrew Ippolito: take away is zero Okay, how would you translate that into the scientific notation well what I write one times one times 10 to the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Negative six good. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so everybody's got to see this when you have negative exponents negative exponents or just another way of writing out very small numbers that are decimals Okay, less than one So if you see a negative exponent that means you're talking about less than one right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so let's say that we add hydrochloric acid, and it goes, all the way up to one times 10 to the negative oh boy one times 10 to the negative one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so, in other words point one miles per liter. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, think of the difference now between this number here, and this number here just in terms of how much bigger that is right that's 110 that's 10 hundred thousand 10,000 hundred thousand that's a million times bigger.\nOK. Andrew Ippolito: Now let's say that I put sodium hydroxide in water instead that's also going to dissociate and i'm going to get a whole bunch of these O H minuses these hydroxide items when I get those those are going to tend to interact with any hydro niamh that happens to be there right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what that's going to do is bring us into just a pair of water molecules and other words adding the sodium hydroxide to water is going to further reduce the concentration of this I drown him.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that we're going to now go down down down to one times 10 to the negative 14th moles per liter.\nAndrew Ippolito: or 1-234-567-8910 1112 1314.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so just think of those three numbers point one right here point oh oh one and point or one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's what we observe in nature. Andrew Ippolito: Okay aqueous solutions have this insanely broad range 14 orders of magnitude.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of this kind of variation everything from hydrochloric acid in your stomach to sodium hydroxide which I can think of where it would naturally live sorry says something pipe deep inside some Oregon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so scientists when they're communicating with each other about these concentrations of things they don't want to keep writing all these huge numbers because it's hard to think about and so all the pH scale is.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's like scientific notation it's a mental shortcut alright so because we're dealing with fractions we're dealing with less than one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right we're always going to have this this concentration of hydroxide or so or a drone em is always going to be less than one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's never going to be a positive number you're never going to have one times 10 to the second.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and if you're not sure if you don't understand that take your coffee and keep adding sugar to it until you have more sugar than your coffee is that really coffee anymore, or is that just kind of coffee flavored sugar.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right take a sugar cube and a dropper and add a drop of coffee on to that cube.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's the only kind of situation where you're going to have more stuff than solution, in which case that's not really a solution that's just like a wet thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this number will eternally always be negative right so when scientists came up with this okay watch this i'm going to can I delete the screen now can I get rid of all this, if you guys want to take a screenshot of this gobbledygook guide but i'm going to delete it right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like the board okay. Andrew Ippolito: Going once going twice.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So what I want to do it as a scientist see we were inventing a system to deal with this range of one times 10 to the negative one, all the way to one times 10 to the negative 14 and I, like, I just want this number right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right I want something that gives me a scale from one to 14 that's just easier to talk about alright so here's what peaches, when you take pH in order to get that mathematically.\nAndrew Ippolito: You would have to take the negative logarithm of that number.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, this right here is the formal definition of pH, it is the negative log of the concentration of hydrogen ions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now if you're like what's a logarithm. Andrew Ippolito: Right, most people when they see that word they.\nAndrew Ippolito: kind of understand that here's the secret all the word longer than means is exponent.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because remember when you first learn logs you had a log with a base of 10 of something so you'd say log of 10 you'd say log 10 of X.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now just replace the word blog with exponent it makes sense that exponent with a base of 10 of X ah, an exponent with a piece of 10 of 710 to the seventh.\nAndrew Ippolito: log seven. Andrew Ippolito: All algorithm is is an exponent just another way of writing it so now you're just saying take the negative log of the exponent.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's where the number comes from. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now here's the thing you can't ignore the other side of the the water you can't ignore the hydroxide right.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a relationship between that H plus and that O H minus because they're part of the same molecule right they come right back together again so it makes sense that, if one of them goes up the other is going to have to go down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right there's a really there's a special relationship here between them, because when they come together they form water they go away completely so wherever there's a pH number there's also what we would say a P O h.\nAndrew Ippolito: And because there's a relationship between them. Andrew Ippolito: The more pH number, the lower the pH number, the higher the concentration of hydrogen ions, the lower the concentration of hydroxide ions and vice versa, and it just turns out the relationship between these is the and together, and you always get 14.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, if your pH is seven your P O H is also seven if your pH is to your P O H is 12.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because 12 plus two is 14. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: We choose to focus on the pH one and everyday life, we talked about the pH of our blood or the pH of your pool or the pH of whatever the pH of your stomach instead of the p O h.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So that's that's.\nAndrew Ippolito: not ask for moles this that you know what I have a PDF file i've actually pulled all this out into a I should really delete this slide I have all this written in in a."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 2) - The Chemistry Of Water | pH and Buffers","link":"https://youtu.be/jCq-wjPqxm0?si=kqp69EXf6D3l38_l","chunkTitle":"Moles and Molar Ratios","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the concept of moles and their importance in relating the number of particles to the mass of a compound.","start":"26:57","end":"31:12","content":"Andrew Ippolito: an essay, I suppose, be a little chapter of some future book or whatever talk explaining all of this, but moles are in relation to pH and all that so all the word mold means did I give you as other Freddie I can't remember.\nAndrew Ippolito: Did I did I explain what i'm all Okay, let me don't read this don't read that just you guys know what the word doesn't means right it doesn't is just 12 things right.\nAndrew Ippolito: A mole. Andrew Ippolito: is just equal to one times 10 to the 23rd ish it's just to just ballpark it 23rd right that's like 112345 had some really big number mind bogglingly big so big that if you take Earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you and you give it a mole of marbles that are about quarter inch diameter, it will completely overwhelm the earth about I think it's like two kilometers thick.\nAndrew Ippolito: just pure marble. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, now, why do we need this number.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I told you, I had this little chunk of carbon here let's say this was one gram of carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if we zoom down inside of it we went down to the electron microscope and we we can look at the actual atoms the question would be is how many atoms are in this graph.\nAndrew Ippolito: How many atoms.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason why this is an important question for us is as we're going to see when we do things like take six molecules of carbon dioxide and as six molecules of water and yield one molecule of glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: plus six molecules of oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, well, we look at equations like this. Andrew Ippolito: When we consider those six things of carbon those six molecules of carbon dioxide those six molecules of water, giving us one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen we don't care about how much they weigh right it's not important that this is maybe a bigger molecule than this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is a huge molecule This is just one of those these are ratios right, and the reason is it's like cooking.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know let's say you were making a brown let's say you were making some cookies over Christmas time and the recipe, you were using call for two cups of sugar to one cup of flour.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right cups. Andrew Ippolito: And so you wait, so your scoop up one cup of sugar and one cup of flour and you immediately notice that the sugar is really heavy compared to the flower.\nAndrew Ippolito: doesn't matter I need one cup of sugar and one cup of flour, independent of how big they are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so in the lab when we're measuring things out we don't have a scale that gives us cramps i'm sorry we don't have a scale that gives us moles we don't have the scale it gives us Adams.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's really what I should have said, to start with, let me say it again, we don't have a scale that gives us atoms I need six.\nAndrew Ippolito: At really molecules I need six molecules of carbon dioxide you can't weigh that out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, all we have in this big macroscopic world beyond the atom is mass the pull of gravity and so we have to figure out a way to to relate how heavy this thing is.\nAndrew Ippolito: To how much we need. Andrew Ippolito: Right so imagine instead of saying one cup of sugar to one cup of flour.\nAndrew Ippolito: I said 12.7 grams of sugar to wanted to 100 grams of flour, or whatever right just you see there's a difference there now so that's why we need Molar ratio that's why we need moles.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, but the mole does is it translates the number of particles of a compound to how heavy it is so we can weigh it out that's why it's useful for us and that's why we think in terms of moles moles remove the idea of how big things are."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 2) - The Chemistry Of Water | pH and Buffers","link":"https://youtu.be/jCq-wjPqxm0?si=kqp69EXf6D3l38_l","chunkTitle":"The Definition of a Mole","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the original definition of a mole and how it was updated in 2013.","start":"31:28","end":"32:06","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and because atoms are so small.

All right. Andrew Ippolito: Here we go, so now we could talk about acids basis and buffers.\nAndrew Ippolito: An acid is anything that associates and water and gives off protons okay so just put this in your head acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then put an arrow and an H plus they give those up. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, they donate proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: So hydrochloric acid is the most stereotypical acid now it's important to understand for this point in the Semester onwards, when we talk about a chemical reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we talk about things happening in the cell or in a test tube don't think of this thing as a single molecule see this as representing an entire population.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are billions of them in there. Andrew Ippolito: And they're not all the same, some things have so in this case, in this case I don't say they're they're not all the same, what makes it acid strong when we see a strong acid, that means that when you drop this in water 100% of that population associates.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what makes it strong all of it does and pretty immediately that's why you never want to add.\nAndrew Ippolito: acid or water to acid.

Andrew Ippolito: And then the other word, you can use your alkaline.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, something is alkaline just means it's basic those are entered you know you don't call something an alkaline it's a base that is alkaline I don't know why we have two words.\nAndrew Ippolito: We don't have been more for aesthetic.

Victoria Bloemker: The higher the number um something beans, what was the.\nAndrew Ippolito: outcome how call line.\nVictoria Bloemker: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so now let's talk about weak acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's a whole class of molecule that we would just collectively term organic acids organic meaning has got carbon and hydrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so each see oh three H2 co three.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason why this is a weak acid is because when you drop that in water, not all of it associates, some of it holds on to its proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so here's where I want you to start building this concept in your mind of a spectrum of compounds that range from hydrochloric acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: All the way to water. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so you can put hcl here and water here and then all the way over here sodium hydroxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so anything in here in this range would be considered a weak acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: In anything in this range would be considered a week base and there's a variation there some acids are weaker than others, some are stronger than others so some might associate.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know 2% and be really weak others might be like 90% really strong are stronger OK, so the idea of a week so just it's not 100%.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's a spectrum there's a range. Andrew Ippolito: So you can have an entire range of peaches so some week SS might give you if you just dropping them water some week SS might give you a pH of five others might give you a pH.\nAndrew Ippolito: 6.2. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, if it's under seven it's acidic.\nAndrew Ippolito: alright. Andrew Ippolito: So let me give you some vegetables now.

Andrew Ippolito: Sorry, a week base would be ammonia.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talked about ammonia earlier today. Andrew Ippolito: When you drop that on water it's going to rip a proton off of water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because of that double that pair of electronic surveillance shell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that data cobell and bonded forms. Which again you all to know that it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but the key is it's going to dramatically increase the concentration of hydrogen ions high hydroxide ions rather.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why we get up there tend to the negative 14 three inch. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: I should say, I should say sodium hydroxide when it associates completely when there's so much of this that's going to.\nAndrew Ippolito: interact with what's little of this left and so that's going to give us this one times 10 to the negative 14 this might give us one time I don't have this number of my head, maybe one times 10 to the negative ninth.\nAndrew Ippolito: place against somewhere between seven and 14 there's your week basis.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So here's here's one way to bit For those of you who are visual like me okay this this is carbonic acid here's your each to co three alright so there's there's a carbon surrounded by three oxygens that red dots and then one of those oxygens has a hydrogen Aman this O h.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so what happens is. Andrew Ippolito: This proton will occasionally fall off why remember oxygen loves electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if you think of the system here as an electron cloud like we play with water just go back to that idea of thinking of the clouds of electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: This whole thing is siphoning the electrons from this hydrogen, this is being held on by a thread, this is a very, very weak bond right here, and so you drop this on water and chances are just going to fall off.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's going to cause this to be a negatively charged Ion and you're gonna its proton.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but this is reversible well another way to think of it as like this that proton can either be on or off."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 3 (Part 2) - The Chemistry Of Water | pH and Buffers","link":"https://youtu.be/jCq-wjPqxm0?si=kqp69EXf6D3l38_l","chunkTitle":"Buffers and pH Moderation","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains how buffers moderate pH changes and maintain a stable environment.","start":"41:44","end":"45:05","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, but this is reversible well another way to think of it as like this that proton can either be on or off.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's not 5050 it tends to be off. Andrew Ippolito: Which is why it's acidic okay does this make sense.\nAll right. questions. alright.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's put carbonic acid in. Andrew Ippolito: A couple of different environments let's say that we had an existing acid.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Where there's a lot of this H plus.\nAndrew Ippolito: So visually, this is what you can imagine, in your head there's more protons hanging around than impure water and so what's going to happen is that's going to tend to push that proton onto the carbonic acid and it's going to act like a base.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, that remember, so a base would be the opposite of an acid it's going to absorb you can think of it as absorbing those proton.\nRight.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you have, in this case on the left hand side there you have a weak acid acting like a base.\nAndrew Ippolito: On the other side let's say that we had too many hydroxide ions well now what's going to happen is if this is the extra hydroxide ions it got everywhere here those hydroxide ions are going to tend to keep that proton and make some water.\nAndrew Ippolito: at the cost of this being negative. Andrew Ippolito: In other words, it's going to act like a stronger acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words carbonic acid, in this case, this week acid comes.\nAndrew Ippolito: To the system. Andrew Ippolito: With his own favorite pH number.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like 6.7 or or 5.2 and.\nAndrew Ippolito: Regardless of what other. Andrew Ippolito: stuff is happening in the environment it's going to keep the pH there, so if you take a solution of carbonic acid you take a solution of this week acid, and you measure its pH right let's do that let's take this little let's take a beaker and as some age to seo three to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and we have a pH meter in there and the pH meter reads, and again I don't have these numbers burned into my head let's just make something up let's call this 5.2.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I have a one Molar solution of each to see oh three and the pH reads is 5.2 because some, but not all those protons are falling off.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I add a little bit of hydrochloric guests to that now. Andrew Ippolito: The pH might drop a little bit, but then come right back.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I had a little bit of sodium hydroxide to it, it might rise, a little bit, but then come right back.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the concept of a buffer. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, a buffer is a weak acid or a week base animal act like its opposite in the extreme environment it's a moderate.\nAndrew Ippolito: It moderates the environment.

Jordan Russell: or something like similar to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah yeah yeah. Andrew Ippolito: brings the pH closer to yeah so like instead of a bring it closer to seven like, if you look at my pen on the screen here let's say this is a pH of seven it's the pH of one pizza 14.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say that you know the neutralization actually wants us to get to seven right so let's say the week acids here like a 5.3, this is the new zero point.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's going to like if we add an asset here it's going to bring it up this way, we had a base over here is going to bring it down this way.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's always going to get to us and, eventually, you can overwhelm it right, you can keep adding acid to this until Finally it collapses, and that would be called the buffers capacity.\nJordan Russell: You reach the buffering capacity of that buffer. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so it is a buffer it makes sense to you does.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, good the reason they're important is we don't if our metabolism as it's going.\nAndrew Ippolito: A lot of the consequences of chemical reactions and ourselves increases or decreases the concentration of these I draw names and hydroxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we want to prevent wild swings of these concentrations, because most of the reactions that we're dealing with are driven by enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: and enzymes me to protein as well learn soon can Demeter they will they will lose their structural integrity in the presence of a pH, that is true dramatically different than what they're used to.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we want to keep the pH of environments near where they are so, for example, your blood pH ranges from 7.35 to 7.45 that's your bloods healthy pH range slightly alkaline.\nAlexa DePrisco: Okay, excuse me yeah. Alexa DePrisco: If you had like.\nAlexa DePrisco: Diabetes or like if you went into like a state of ketosis would that be affecting the acidity or.\nAlexa DePrisco: Yes, your blood. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yes. Andrew Ippolito: I think especially ketosis that will make it more acidic I believe or more don't quote me on that don't call me on that I don't have the physiology of my head, but yes, it will the pH of your blood, if your PhD are blessed with acid Josias and I think Alcatraz is those are.\nAndrew Ippolito: very dangerous places to be because your metabolism starts getting very quickly out of whack and you can maintain.\nAlexa DePrisco: homeostasis and then with the clotting disorder would that have to do with the pH of your blood or no, no clotting.\nAndrew Ippolito: clotting disorders have more to do with.\nAndrew Ippolito: Protein interactions and cell the cell adhesion problems that's that's the best I could do with that without digging into the research more and learning about myself more recording disorders, this isn't this isn't that's not a precipitation we actually do the pH necessarily.\nAlexa DePrisco: All right, thank you sure. Andrew Ippolito: i'll look that up it do me a favor type that type that into our persistent chat so I don't forget that's that's a question I want to look up clotting disorders, I don't I don't think it has to do with pH, but I could be wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: I just gave you all the practical application stuff right, so we care about this, because it has to do with.\nAndrew Ippolito: It will severely impact the biology of the system. Andrew Ippolito: And so I put this together, last year I really like this is this is everything we've talked about in one slide.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see the range and really it's a spectrum of how much or how little the molecule reacts with approved on.\nAndrew Ippolito: There you can see, in the middle here the water molecule has some on and off rate right that dissociation read that gives us the one times 10 to the negative seven oh boy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Say one a negative seven right the hydrochloric acid, you can see, mostly all of it falls off, whereas the sodium hydroxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mostly stays off.\nAndrew Ippolito: or I should say the sodium hydroxide here's the here's any oh hd hydroxide pulls it like a magnet.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and then you can see the weak ones, you see the arrows are just favoring one side or the other right, and this is just the spectrum the spectrum of of buffering and peak.\nAndrew Ippolito: Time so let's do one little practical application, we can see here's the mitochondria will learn about this later in the Semester we've all seen pictures of the mitochondria the powerhouse of the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, one thing we're going to do later in the Semester is we're going to watch as we pump this space in here, full of protons we're going to change the pH in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to drop the pH and then we're going to use that gradient. Andrew Ippolito: To flow downhill and generate a force to make some energy alright, so the idea here is we're going to change the pH of this environment we're gonna have a low pH.\nhere. And the pH in here is going to be higher.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's do the same thing and chloroplasts. Andrew Ippolito: And so now, you can get this in your head life is all about establishing and maintaining concentration gradients and so in this case, this is a concentration gradient of protons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right we'll talk more about this later in the Semester that's that that's water in a nutshell.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's all gonna stop the recording you can just watch this later and water."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Basic Organic Chemistry","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the topic of basic organic chemistry, discussing the nature of carbon, carbon backbones, and functional groups.","start":"0:01","end":"1:24","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is the first lecture on organic molecules and what what you're going to see here your book splits this up into basic organic chemistry talking about.\nAndrew Ippolito: The nature of carbon and carbon backbones and functional groups, and then the next chapter, we begin to the four major classes of organic molecule that's important to biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so up to this point let's just kind of think about where we've come we've talked about all matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is made out of these things, these protons and neutrons and electrons that together form these atoms that define the various elements that combine to form these molecules and these compounds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and the molecules and compounds include a subset.

Andrew Ippolito: This guy. Andrew Ippolito: Anybody know who, that is.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is, do we pester the father of Microbiology.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's the one that definitively disproved the theory of spontaneous generation, the idea that life can come from an organic material like flies can arise spontaneously from rotting meat or mice arise from discarded garbage.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, however, he was a vital list What that means is. Andrew Ippolito: We used to think that there was another force of nature, we talked about you know electromagnetism and gravity the strong and weak force, well, we used to think there was this scientific model that there was a life force.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like in Star Wars. Andrew Ippolito: Star Wars, the force is this life force that permeates all life.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we call that the vital force the living force. Andrew Ippolito: And louie pesto, was a proponent of this now outmoded theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we came up with this kind of bifurcation and chemistry between the living chemistry and the dead chemistry organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: It turns out that organic molecules. Andrew Ippolito: don't have any.\nAndrew Ippolito: That we can detect any way forced to them that's any different than any other molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: So today, when we define organic compounds it's not that they came from a living cells so much as they have a lot of carbon and nitrogen they're made out of carbon and nitrogen so any molecule at all.\nAndrew Ippolito: That has both carbon and hydrogen is considered an organic molecule and, yes, these are the most abundant life specific elements.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so organic molecules are things that lack one or the other, or both Okay, they don't contain both of them, so you have to have both of them, not one or the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so things like sodium chloride ammonia and phosphoric acid are in organic molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so ammonia, despite the fact that has a hydrogen and it doesn't have carbon in it, so we don't classify that as an organic molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's two I like to call them honorary Members of the organic family that has carbon dioxide and water, because without either of these molecules there is no organic chemistry of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right carbon dioxide is technically inorganic because it doesn't have hydrogen and water is definitely interesting because it likes carbon you put them together and you get sugar.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: So I like to say as a biologist not a chemist informally, we will honor we will induct them as honorary Members in the organic chemistry family, because you really can't do much without them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but at the College level here understand organic doesn't mean carbon it means carbon and hydrogen.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so carbon let's talk about our friend carbon now like really talk about carbon carbon at atomic number six.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has a Valence of floor, which means it has four electrons in his village show and the electron configuration gives carbon a lot of varied a lot of diversity and it shapes.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and I can, I have a little picture up here i'm never gonna hold you to any of this, this is not a chemistry class, this is a biology class, but it is useful to think about these all right, if you take the one s orbital.\nAndrew Ippolito: And all three of the different pi orbitals in that second show the X y&z X, Y amp Z axis ones, you get this what's called tetrahedron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is the shape of forums right, so it just picture you're squishing all these electrons together in these various orbitals and they hate each other, and so they form this brand new.\nAndrew Ippolito: dance we call a hybrid orbital. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, instead of having.\nAndrew Ippolito: A one s orbital and a to px orbital an.\nAndrew Ippolito: or but i'll instead carbon has. Andrew Ippolito: 12342468 SP three orbitals.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: This is part of what's called vesper which you'll learn about in chemistry vesper theory is the modern version, the modern take on the most accurate.\nAndrew Ippolito: vespers the most accurate way of predicting.\nmolecular shapes. and interactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Its balance balance electron I forgot what the stands for.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, the concept of hybrid orbitals you have these things together, and you get in your shapes okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, sometimes carbon depending on how many bonds it's forming can form different hybrid orbitals right, so the SP two is when we take.\nAndrew Ippolito: Two pi orbitals and that gives us this planar it looks like a three leaf clover.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that is planar it's flat Okay, the tetrahedron is three dimensional.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is planar and then Lastly, you can just do an SP orbital this is how you would do the triple bond.\nWhich is rare. Andrew Ippolito: And that's just forums linear just connection.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So, because carbon has.\nAndrew Ippolito: This electron configuration, it can form, all of these different shapes, this is why carbon is the source of all of this molecular diversity."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Functional Groups: Hydroxyl Group","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the hydroxyl functional group, its role in making molecules polar, and its association with alcohols.","start":"9:09","end":"13:22","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This electron configuration, it can form, all of these different shapes, this is why carbon is the source of all of this molecular diversity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so carbon has a few unique properties that make carbon carbon it can form.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look on the right hand side here single bonds.\nIt can form chains. Andrew Ippolito: Double bonds.\nrings. branches. Okay, it can form all these different shapes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what makes carbon really special is it can form bonds with itself as chance it can make itself into a cheap that's called Cantonese.\nCantonese. Cantonese means to put into.\nAndrew Ippolito: Put into chance if you've ever heard the word concatenate.\nAndrew Ippolito: or concatenation that means put things all put it put them all together by took your my first name Andrew my second name it believe Oh, and I concatenate them I would get one word Andrew pulido.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what concatenate okay sounds county. Andrew Ippolito: And form follows function we've talked about that, so far, a lot, the idea that carbons form allows it to have all these various functions varying forms bearing functions okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so in 3D we can even go 3D so karmin can form. Andrew Ippolito: A dizzying array of structures, it can form these complex soccer ball shapes called figurines.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first one of these discovered was a guy named buckminster Dr buckminster, and so we call these things.\nbucky balls. Andrew Ippolito: We can form tubes of carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can form single molecular sheets of carbon this stuff right here graphene, this is the future of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Material science graphene has amazing properties, it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: From what I remember reading anyway it's a superconductor at room temperature.\nAndrew Ippolito: It has a tensile strength of about that of steel.\nAndrew Ippolito: It sheds he really fast, and now I just read the other day.\nthey're able to use it in. Andrew Ippolito: some kind of sense that, like a sensor technology that's going to revolutionize.\nAndrew Ippolito: The sensing radio waves, they were doing something with oh 5g networks, so this is going to change them.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're going to make your wi fi better i'll just leave it at that, so graphene is a magic it's this magic material it's amazing.\nAndrew Ippolito: diamond. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so so structures of diamond and graphite Okay, so if you're using a pencil think of the different in a pencil on a diamond The only difference between them is the configuration on the carbon atoms.\nRight. Angela Harbeck: Or we can do these like the structures and.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not going to have a lineup like. Angela Harbeck: match the name to the shape now.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have more important things to put in our heads right now. Like the functional groups you'll have to know those.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so here if we look at this that's that's an animation that doesn't work anymore it's just it just plays a video that shows all this anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so when we talk about organic compounds now we're gonna see that these four major classes, that we talked about the proteins carbohydrates, the lipids nucleic acids as different as they are from each other, they are all built from the same basic schematic a carbon skeleton.\nAndrew Ippolito: So a carbon skeleton is a chain or a ring or branches or whatever carbon skeleton and associated what we're called functional groups which we're going to learn that."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Functional Groups: Carbonyl Group","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the carbonyl functional group, its presence in aldehydes and ketones, and its contribution to polarity.","start":"13:22","end":"17:58","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So a carbon skeleton is a chain or a ring or branches or whatever carbon skeleton and associated what we're called functional groups which we're going to learn that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the combination of those gives us an incredible array of structure, and this is what ultimately gives rise to the diversity we see in life, the differences in the starfish and the jellyfish and the bald eagle and everything in between.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And we name organic compounds between both the functional groups and their chemical properties and sometimes our corporate skeleton really.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's this thing called are you pack nomenclature.\nAndrew Ippolito: I pack nomenclature, is to chemistry what taxonomy is.\nAndrew Ippolito: To biology it's a way of classifying things and naming them so in binomial nomenclature.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually yeah let's say the Cross out the word taxonomy or notes it's really it's closer to buy binomial nomenclature I a peck stands for the International Union of pure and applied chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you'll probably see that in your chemistry class to this is why, how you get things like one to die bends a week sodium di sulfate whenever I was making them look at the back of your shampoo bottle.\nAndrew Ippolito: All those words that's from audio pack nomenclature somebody who is fluent in Arabic nomenclature can read that word and draw structure of it.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, here we go functional groups.\nAndrew Ippolito: The concept here is that it is a part of a molecule that has a distinct set of chemical properties, independent of the rest of the molecule and I.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll see here I capitalized our rest on purpose we're going to write it like this are here let's give you one do each group that are could be anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: It could be a whole big long chain of carbon, it could be you it doesn't matter it just means it's what we're talking about it's independent of the rest of the molecule it brings to the table its own sense of identity.\nAndrew Ippolito: It defines itself into the strong personality.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay So here we go. Andrew Ippolito: These are the things that are directly involved in chemical reactions, so you can see that's why they're important.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's not considered a functional group until it's patched to the molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Otherwise it's just an eye on or something. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and when it is attached whatever it's attached to that thing its name is driven in part by this function.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So you should have heard of ethane hydrocarbon that's explosive an ethanol, which is an alcoholic some people drink.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, these names are different because of different functional groups.\nAlexa DePrisco: I like to think of functional groups like. Andrew Ippolito: legos go ahead Angela. Angela Harbeck: You were just because I didn't say anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, your MIC one hot really quickly. Alexa DePrisco: Sorry that's me. Alexa DePrisco: I had a question about functional groups, could you liken that to like when you have a chemical reaction, you have like the net reaction, which is like where stuff actually happens versus like the entire thing the um the complete.\nAndrew Ippolito: hey I feel like you're focusing on a specific. Andrew Ippolito: Part of the molecule and that thing happens right here, yes that's yeah it's like when you look at the detailed formula.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you see like the like you've heard of hydrophobic attack or whatever you know you have some molecule and there's an O each group on it and some other molecule and that's got an H, and the reaction happens here.\nAlexa DePrisco: that's what we're talking about you'll. Andrew Ippolito: it'll it'll become more clear and then the. Andrew Ippolito: Forthcoming slides to but yes that's the idea, instead of just generically we're talking about where the actual chemistry happens.\nAlexa DePrisco: So I like to think of functional groups is this specific different legos. Andrew Ippolito: Right, if you have a Lego pilot arm and you play with legos you take a bunch of tires out of the now, you can make something that rolls.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right or put this on top of it now you have a door, or you can make some other kind of moving part right or a door hinge or you know or or sometimes they're just structural pieces.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so the idea here is we're going to add these components to a molecule to make them do specific things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so here's we're going to go through them one by one, now, this is, these are detailed.\nAndrew Ippolito: descriptions of things, the first one we're going to talk about it's called the hydroxyl functional group which is just an O H, so you would write like this always don't don't forget the are because it's not a functional group, otherwise our O h."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Functional Groups: Carboxyl Group","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the carboxyl functional group, its acidity, and its role in organic acids.","start":"17:58","end":"21:57","content":"Andrew Ippolito: descriptions of things, the first one we're going to talk about it's called the hydroxyl functional group which is just an O H, so you would write like this always don't don't forget the are because it's not a functional group, otherwise our O h.\nAndrew Ippolito: And just as a point of interest if I just wrote oh ah what's that we already met him in the last chapter that's the hydrox as the hydroxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the hydroxide Ion when attached to a carbon scaffold becomes the hydroxyl functional group.\nsee that. Andrew Ippolito: And these are the functional groups we associate with alcohols.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so if you take. Andrew Ippolito: A carbon molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like just let's just take let's start with I didn't teach you the basics of naming things with carbon so let's do that so here's carbon and let's just give carbon for hydrogens.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's call that ch for. Andrew Ippolito: because those are all single bonded hydrogens that's that's the default.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon backbone. This is methane, a any.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so math when you see math that's one carbon if I took two carbons and I put them together and I gave the rest of them hydrogens there.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's effing. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, three would be propane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Forest butane. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can do this, you can do math.\nAndrew Ippolito: s. Pro. beauty.\nhacks. Have.\nAndrew Ippolito: known and deck that's your first 10 methane same propane butane pentium hexane obtain octane no name decade and you can just keep going from there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you don't have to memorize these for this class but knowing, this will help you understand, other things in this class and will obviously help you in your chemistry.\nOK. Andrew Ippolito: So the eight me at the end of it when you see a hydrocarbon with eight and he that just means its simplest form a single bonds of hydrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here over here here's effing.\nOkay, which is what we're talking about now. Andrew Ippolito: And let's introduce some short hand drawing now watch this if I draw just this you see how I do this it looks like an upside down be okay, what I want you to see that, as is three carbons, each with their hydrogens.\nSo that would be what see three H 368.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so watch this I can this zigzag zigzag zigzag right now I can draw carbon jeans or I can draw a carbon ring.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or, I can draw something that's branched Okay, the lines represent fully.\nAndrew Ippolito: saturated carbons with hydrogen when I say saturated I mean unless it says otherwise you can assume that when you see this doodle there are all of the hydrogens air and remember that carbon forms for bonds total right so just fill the space with hydrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so anything in this format would just be a straight line right to carbon with nothing else on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is the chemical shorthand we're going to use all semester how we're going to do to everything and you'll use that in your chemistry classes do Okay, so when there are functional groups attached.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Functional Groups: Amino Group","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the amino functional group, its basicity, and its presence in amino acids.","start":"21:57","end":"25:19","content":"Andrew Ippolito: First of all, save the screen if you need to write all that stuff down, otherwise you can come back to the video but i'm going to clear this right now 321 clear.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so watch this methane i've seen pro there's propane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and here is propanol.\nAndrew Ippolito: I just put a hydroxyl group.

Andrew Ippolito: Otherwise, if you just see it floating around like this that's just an eye on right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we'll see you know this is phosphoric acid. And that's the phosphate group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay alright, so the next group Okay, so what what properties does this give us this makes everything that is attached to it polar that's the key here and that's why essien.\nAndrew Ippolito: nonpolar gas at room temperature ethanol, with its extra polarity liquid at room temperature.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So it's polar, so this is how you can make things more polar take him away less polar okay so that's what I want you to associate hydroxyl groups with polarity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Things that have hydroxyl groups can engage in bonding with water and a whole bunch of other things that's, this is what makes things useful.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, the next function on group is called a car bottle functional group the car bonnell functional group is a double bond oxygen just by itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so I just doodled a chain of carbon there and I just put it notice, I put it at the end of the chain do you see that I put the double bond Oh, at the end I couldn't put it on the other end I could have put it here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but I put it at the end okay now watch this here's another carbon chain i'm going to put the double bond oh somewhere in the middle, you see the difference.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the double bond oh is, at the end of the chain or somewhere in the middle of that chain, and that leads into two classes of organic compounds.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know you're out the highs and your ketones and Al to hide is an organic compound where the car bonnell functional group sits as a chain it's called a chain terminator.\nthat's not the end of a chain.

Andrew Ippolito: But that's less than formative and that's it's hard to see it, so this is how I want you to write it on your notebook in your notebook okay start with a carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that carbon is actually part of the function.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'm a top here at an angle we're going to put a double bond Oh, just like we did in the car bomb on group.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that fourth bond that carbon is attached to. Andrew Ippolito: Is the hydroxyl group here, and so this whole system.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is has a defined function itself think of it like a compound word fire and you got man and yeah fire man right, this is like a compound word in that sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why we have this one thing and we call it the car boxful functional group is because it acts like an acid look at it it's got this hydrogen right here, just like we talked about H2 co three earlier.\nAndrew Ippolito: This confers acidity. Andrew Ippolito: To whatever it's attached to.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in fact so let's learn our first organic molecule here we'll talk about even more later draw a chain and carbon and then at the very end of it draw that put a double bondo.\nAndrew Ippolito: In a single bond oh ah here, and this thing is called a fatty.\nAndrew Ippolito: acid you've heard of fatty acids before that's a fatty acid just take the car box look group at the end.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason mind this is acidic is because oxygen loves electrons these this this oxygen here, and this oxygen here all contribute to pulling away the electrons from this hydrogen leading it to tend to fall off and solution.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the Ionized version of this would look like this. whoops do that better.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that I just put a negative there that's what it would do in water now it's an eye on.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we find carb oxalic groups in the family of things well the carb oxalic acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: me so vinegar is a scenic acid that's entered vinegar is acidic acid and acidic acid is basically.\nTwo carbons with a.\nAndrew Ippolito: functional riveters there's acid or i'm sorry there's there's vinegar it's an organic acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and will also learn about amino acid shortly.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: The next one. Andrew Ippolito: The amino group this one's easy take ammonia and stick it on to a molecule and you get the amino group alright so remember ammonia is nh three.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if you remove one of the hydrogens from it right so here and ha Ha ha right that's ammonia get rid of one of these leeches so that we can attach it to a carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now we're nh two. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, but it still has that lone pair of electrons and it's still basic so the ammonia group i'm sorry the amino group contributes to making things more alkaline.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the family of molecules that have these are called the Amiens.\nRight like maybe you've heard of glucose me. Andrew Ippolito: Right or maybe you've heard something called a vitamin you have to take your vitamins right the word itself vitamin is derived from saying the phrase out loud, these are your vital."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Introduction","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the concept of dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis reactions, which are fundamental to building and breaking polymers.","start":"0:00","end":"4:30","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is the first lecture on organic molecules and what what you're going to see here your book splits this up into basic organic chemistry talking about.\nAndrew Ippolito: The nature of carbon and carbon backbones and functional groups, and then the next chapter, we begin to the four major classes of organic molecule that's important to biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so up to this point let's just kind of think about where we've come we've talked about all matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is made out of these things, these protons and neutrons and electrons that together form these atoms that define the various elements that combine to form these molecules and these compounds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and the molecules and compounds include a subset. Andrew Ippolito: That will call the organic compound alright, the ones that include that are made out of both carbon and hydrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to learn about the four classes and the next presentation The carbohydrates, the lipids the nucleic acids and proteins these make up life.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what are these molecules made out of they're made from a combination of some carbon backbone.\nAndrew Ippolito: and associated functional groups like on the bells and the whistles.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we'll learn about things like the hydroxyl group the car bottle group the amino group, etc.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the combination between the backbone, and these functional groups gives rise to the various chemical properties of the various molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: Things like being hydrophobic or hide your affiliate are acidic or alkaline or polar nonpolar and some things are just structural functional so really this should say chemical where's my mouse.\nAndrew Ippolito: Chemical physical properties right hydrophobic I feel like as in chemical that's a physical property.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right chemical properties deal with breaking bonds and changing physical properties, you would see changes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right, so we go all the way back to the here's anybody who, that is.\nSami Jordan: What screen, or you share something on the screen. Sami Jordan: it's all black screen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh wait, how long has it been like that. Sami Jordan: Since you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just went through a whole slow okay hold on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sorry guys. Andrew Ippolito: Can you see that now. Andrew Ippolito: i'm gonna start this over.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now if you're watching in the future, my apologies for just talking to a black screen so here's what I just talked about I went through this matters made out of these of item lot, but I have to do, but up it up that includes the data there we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is just a fun slide to talk through to get to the point where we're going to talk about organic chemistry.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: This guy. Andrew Ippolito: Anybody know who, that is.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is, do we pester the father of Microbiology.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's the one that definitively disproved the theory of spontaneous generation, the idea that life can come from an organic material like flies can arise spontaneously from rotting meat or mice arise from discarded garbage.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, however, he was a vital list What that means is. Andrew Ippolito: We used to think that there was another force of nature, we talked about you know electromagnetism and gravity the strong and weak force, well, we used to think there was this scientific model that there was a life force.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like in Star Wars. Andrew Ippolito: Star Wars, the force is this life force that permeates all life.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we call that the vital force the living force. Andrew Ippolito: And louie pesto, was a proponent of this now outmoded theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we came up with this kind of bifurcation and chemistry between the living chemistry and the dead chemistry organic chemistry and inorganic chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: It turns out that organic molecules. Andrew Ippolito: don't have any.\nAndrew Ippolito: That we can detect any way forced to them that's any different than any other molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: So today, when we define organic compounds it's not that they came from a living cells so much as they have a lot of carbon and nitrogen they're made out of carbon and nitrogen so any molecule at all.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Dehydration Synthesis","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of dehydration synthesis, where two molecules are joined together by removing a water molecule.","start":"4:30","end":"10:15","content":"Andrew Ippolito: That has both carbon and hydrogen is considered an organic molecule and, yes, these are the most abundant life specific elements.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so organic molecules are things that lack one or the other, or both Okay, they don't contain both of them, so you have to have both of them, not one or the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so things like sodium chloride ammonia and phosphoric acid are in organic molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so ammonia, despite the fact that has a hydrogen and it doesn't have carbon in it, so we don't classify that as an organic molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's two I like to call them honorary Members of the organic family that has carbon dioxide and water, because without either of these molecules there is no organic chemistry of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right carbon dioxide is technically inorganic because it doesn't have hydrogen and water is definitely interesting because it likes carbon you put them together and you get sugar.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: So I like to say as a biologist not a chemist informally, we will honor we will induct them as honorary Members in the organic chemistry family, because you really can't do much without them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, but at the College level here understand organic doesn't mean carbon it means carbon and hydrogen.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so carbon let's talk about our friend carbon now like really talk about carbon carbon at atomic number six.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has a Valence of floor, which means it has four electrons in his village show and the electron configuration gives carbon a lot of varied a lot of diversity and it shapes.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and I can, I have a little picture up here i'm never gonna hold you to any of this, this is not a chemistry class, this is a biology class, but it is useful to think about these all right, if you take the one s orbital.\nAndrew Ippolito: And all three of the different pi orbitals in that second show the X y&z X, Y amp Z axis ones, you get this what's called tetrahedron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is the shape of forums right, so it just picture you're squishing all these electrons together in these various orbitals and they hate each other, and so they form this brand new.\nAndrew Ippolito: dance we call a hybrid orbital. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, instead of having.\nAndrew Ippolito: A one s orbital and a to px orbital an.\nAndrew Ippolito: or but i'll instead carbon has. Andrew Ippolito: 12342468 SP three orbitals.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: This is part of what's called vesper which you'll learn about in chemistry vesper theory is the modern version, the modern take on the most accurate.\nAndrew Ippolito: vespers the most accurate way of predicting.\nmolecular shapes. and interactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Its balance balance electron I forgot what the stands for.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, the concept of hybrid orbitals you have these things together, and you get in your shapes okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, sometimes carbon depending on how many bonds it's forming can form different hybrid orbitals right, so the SP two is when we take.\nAndrew Ippolito: Two pi orbitals and that gives us this planar it looks like a three leaf clover.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that is planar it's flat Okay, the tetrahedron is three dimensional.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is planar and then Lastly, you can just do an SP orbital this is how you would do the triple bond.\nWhich is rare. Andrew Ippolito: And that's just forums linear just connection.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So, because carbon has.\nAndrew Ippolito: This electron configuration, it can form, all of these different shapes, this is why carbon is the source of all of this molecular diversity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so carbon has a few unique properties that make carbon carbon it can form.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look on the right hand side here single bonds.\nIt can form chains. Andrew Ippolito: Double bonds.\nrings. branches. Okay, it can form all these different shapes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what makes carbon really special is it can form bonds with itself as chance it can make itself into a cheap that's called Cantonese.\nCantonese. Cantonese means to put into.\nAndrew Ippolito: Put into chance if you've ever heard the word concatenate.\nAndrew Ippolito: or concatenation that means put things all put it put them all together by took your my first name Andrew my second name it believe Oh, and I concatenate them I would get one word Andrew pulido.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Hydrolysis","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses hydrolysis, the reverse of dehydration synthesis, where a water molecule is added to break a bond between molecules.","start":"10:15","end":"15:45","content":"Andrew Ippolito: that's what concatenate okay sounds county.

Andrew Ippolito: A dizzying array of structures, it can form these complex soccer ball shapes called figurines.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first one of these discovered was a guy named buckminster Dr buckminster, and so we call these things.\nbucky balls. Andrew Ippolito: We can form tubes of carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can form single molecular sheets of carbon this stuff right here graphene, this is the future of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Material science graphene has amazing properties, it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: From what I remember reading anyway it's a superconductor at room temperature.\nAndrew Ippolito: It has a tensile strength of about that of steel.\nAndrew Ippolito: It sheds he really fast, and now I just read the other day.\nthey're able to use it in.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so so structures of diamond and graphite Okay, so if you're using a pencil think of the different in a pencil on a diamond The only difference between them is the configuration on the carbon atoms.\nRight. Angela Harbeck: Or we can do these like the structures and.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not going to have a lineup like. Angela Harbeck: match the name to the shape now.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have more important things to put in our heads right now. Like the functional groups you'll have to know those.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so here if we look at this that's that's an animation that doesn't work anymore it's just it just plays a video that shows all this anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so when we talk about organic compounds now we're gonna see that these four major classes, that we talked about the proteins carbohydrates, the lipids nucleic acids as different as they are from each other, they are all built from the same basic schematic a carbon skeleton.\nAndrew Ippolito: So a carbon skeleton is a chain or a ring or branches or whatever carbon skeleton and associated what we're called functional groups which we're going to learn that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the combination of those gives us an incredible array of structure, and this is what ultimately gives rise to the diversity we see in life, the differences in the starfish and the jellyfish and the bald eagle and everything in between.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And we name organic compounds between both the functional groups and their chemical properties and sometimes our corporate skeleton really.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's this thing called are you pack nomenclature.\nAndrew Ippolito: I pack nomenclature, is to chemistry what taxonomy is.\nAndrew Ippolito: To biology it's a way of classifying things and naming them so in binomial nomenclature.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually yeah let's say the Cross out the word taxonomy or notes it's really it's closer to buy binomial nomenclature I a peck stands for the International Union of pure and applied chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you'll probably see that in your chemistry class to this is why, how you get things like one to die bends a week sodium di sulfate whenever I was making them look at the back of your shampoo bottle.\nAndrew Ippolito: All those words that's from audio pack nomenclature somebody who is fluent in Arabic nomenclature can read that word and draw structure of it.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, here we go functional groups.\nAndrew Ippolito: The concept here is that it is a part of a molecule that has a distinct set of chemical properties, independent of the rest of the molecule and I.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll see here I capitalized our rest on purpose we're going to write it like this are here let's give you one do each group that are could be anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: It could be a whole big long chain of carbon, it could be you it doesn't matter it just means it's what we're talking about it's independent of the rest of the molecule it brings to the table its own sense of identity.\nAndrew Ippolito: It defines itself into the strong personality.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay So here we go. Andrew Ippolito: These are the things that are directly involved in chemical reactions, so you can see that's why they're important.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Anabolic and Catabolic Reactions","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the difference between anabolic reactions (building reactions) and catabolic reactions (breaking reactions), and how they relate to energy usage.","start":"15:45","end":"20:10","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And it's not considered a functional group until it's patched to the molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Otherwise it's just an eye on or something.

Andrew Ippolito: So you should have heard of ethane hydrocarbon that's explosive an ethanol, which is an alcoholic some people drink.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, these names are different because of different functional groups.\nAlexa DePrisco: I like to think of functional groups like. Andrew Ippolito: legos go ahead Angela. Angela Harbeck: You were just because I didn't say anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, your MIC one hot really quickly. Alexa DePrisco: Sorry that's me. Alexa DePrisco: I had a question about functional groups, could you liken that to like when you have a chemical reaction, you have like the net reaction, which is like where stuff actually happens versus like the entire thing the um the complete.\nAndrew Ippolito: hey I feel like you're focusing on a specific. Andrew Ippolito: Part of the molecule and that thing happens right here, yes that's yeah it's like when you look at the detailed formula.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you see like the like you've heard of hydrophobic attack or whatever you know you have some molecule and there's an O each group on it and some other molecule and that's got an H, and the reaction happens here.\nAlexa DePrisco: that's what we're talking about you'll. Andrew Ippolito: it'll it'll become more clear and then the. Andrew Ippolito: Forthcoming slides to but yes that's the idea, instead of just generically we're talking about where the actual chemistry happens.\nAlexa DePrisco: So I like to think of functional groups is this specific different legos. Andrew Ippolito: Right, if you have a Lego pilot arm and you play with legos you take a bunch of tires out of the now, you can make something that rolls.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right or put this on top of it now you have a door, or you can make some other kind of moving part right or a door hinge or you know or or sometimes they're just structural pieces.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so the idea here is we're going to add these components to a molecule to make them do specific things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so here's we're going to go through them one by one, now, this is, these are detailed.\nAndrew Ippolito: descriptions of things, the first one we're going to talk about it's called the hydroxyl functional group which is just an O H, so you would write like this always don't don't forget the are because it's not a functional group, otherwise our O h.\nAndrew Ippolito: And just as a point of interest if I just wrote oh ah what's that we already met him in the last chapter that's the hydrox as the hydroxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the hydroxide Ion when attached to a carbon scaffold becomes the hydroxyl functional group.\nsee that. Andrew Ippolito: And these are the functional groups we associate with alcohols.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so if you take. Andrew Ippolito: A carbon molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like just let's just take let's start with I didn't teach you the basics of naming things with carbon so let's do that so here's carbon and let's just give carbon for hydrogens.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's call that ch for. Andrew Ippolito: because those are all single bonded hydrogens that's that's the default.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon backbone. This is methane, a any.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so math when you see math that's one carbon if I took two carbons and I put them together and I gave the rest of them hydrogens there.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's effing. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, three would be propane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Forest butane. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can do this, you can do math.\nAndrew Ippolito: s. Pro. beauty.\nhacks. Have.\nAndrew Ippolito: known and deck that's your first 10 methane same propane butane pentium hexane obtain octane no name decade and you can just keep going from there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you don't have to memorize these for this class but knowing, this will help you understand, other things in this class and will obviously help you in your chemistry.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 4 - Organic Molecules","link":"https://youtu.be/RfQFMqGcIGQ?si=MinV7lUxTqQ_HsoY","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Carbohydrates","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains the concept of carbohydrates and their role in the body.

Andrew Ippolito: sugars, is that ratio that golden ratio of one to two to one that's sorry I don't mean to call it the gold it's not the golden ratio that's something else, but this is the the special ratio of what makes sugar sugar's is they generally have this this ratio.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and for mono saccharine they serve as immediate energy sources.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's their major goal. Andrew Ippolito: There was their second say goal their second purpose is to actually serve as building blocks for more complex thing.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, so here are the chemical structures, the structural formulas of the three common texas's notice that fruit toasts his pen turmeric or as glucose and galactose or hex America right, you see, this is a five member ring.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can see that it's got these two carbons sticking up in space here. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, this is part of the reason why fructose is special why we shouldn't be eating it, not because of its structure, necessarily, but that is metabolized fundamentally differently.\nAndrew Ippolito: than glucose i'll teach you that a little bit later then there's also something called glucose mean which becomes a special sugar in some polymers like titan which will see in a bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: glucose one is basically a modified sugar what we're gonna do is rip one of these hydroxide is off and put it in amino group in there.\nAnd so it becomes a glucose to me. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so they're your hex of sugars and three colonizers I should just popped up I don't know why I had that animated I silly all right and here's ribosome regulus.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are the two Pinto sugars that will will find in nucleic acids shortly, at the end of this lecture will see these and on the bottom here this right below so we're going to see him play a role in the Calvin cycle and photosynthesis later in the Semester it's chapter 10.\nAndrew Ippolito: Should capitalize that minus one okay.

Andrew Ippolito: So you have to supply them with extra insulin. Andrew Ippolito: You can avoid type two diabetes generally by having a well balanced diet eating healthy exercising regularly and not drinking a whole bunch of what we call high fructose corn syrup.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so fructose the reason why fructose is bad for us is because, when we eat, so we got this stuff called sucrose.\nAndrew Ippolito: sucrose is both glucose and fructose.\nAndrew Ippolito: High fructose corn syrup just has more of this stuff in it from chemical processes for extracting corn.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when we eat glucose we either use it, or we lose it it goes out through your urine if you don't use it in your your P would have a higher concentration glucose fructose has to go to the liver.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where is then processed into a fatty acid, and if you don't use that right away, it goes into your adipose tissue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so nature, this one, I was, I remember, I was still I still remember the moment I had this thought I was walking out my neighborhood around the circle, and I was thinking about sucrose."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 1) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/ZeHU3bpMwoA?si=cAV1N-euy1E2XOTg","chunkTitle":"Cellulose Structure","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the structure of cellulose and the formation of flat chains due to alternating alpha and beta configurations.","start":"37:50","end":"39:26","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so nature, this one, I was, I remember, I was still I still remember the moment I had this thought I was walking out my neighborhood around the circle, and I was thinking about sucrose.\nAndrew Ippolito: And isn't it amazing so we're going to see you later on with your genetics plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Co evolved with animals right flowering plants in particular are so wildly successful because the Insects are so wildly successful.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know the idea of insects pollinating flowers that whole relationship there and nectar nectar was the thing that got the flowers to convince the insects to come and get their pollen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Stick the pollen to their bodies and.

Andrew Ippolito: The reason why margarine exists as a product is because, as we were learning.\nAndrew Ippolito: Jordans literally holding up country cry Thank you Jordan. Andrew Ippolito: The reason why we have these things is we used to think that butter was bad for us.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because it was a soldering temperature might give us clogged arteries, and it was heart attacks, and so they invented they took vegetable oil and they chemically treated it so that they could force it to be more saturated but not too much.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you can think of a spectrum between you know hardcore butter and extra virgin olive oil and margarine is kind of in the middle there this mushy semi solid.\nAndrew Ippolito: And turns out from a health perspective that butters just as fine as margarine to you so it's just a matter of preference and so ready what i'm about to teach you is going to blow your mind.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason why you leave your butter in the refrigerator right raise your hand if you put your butter on their fridge.\nrater if you don't. Andrew Ippolito: Who leaves or butter at room temperature.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody. Andrew Ippolito: room temperature yes okay why.\nTaylor Campbell: Go ahead any of you just start talking my mom likes to keep it out so it's soft.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that that's a that's why we do it right it's right it's a pain in the ass to spread cold butter, nobody likes spreading called butter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: But here's the thing. Andrew Ippolito: you're not supposed to refrigerated.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the mind blowing thing I learned this back in 2008 when I went to England, I went on a trip to England, with my wife and we went all throughout the English countryside went to Scotland and Wales, it was a wonderful trip I fell in love with Scotland and the one thing we noticed.\nJordan Russell: Everywhere, we went. Andrew Ippolito: We stayed in bed and breakfasts and various places and their butter was always at room temperature and we learned when we asked about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: They said, like Oh, Chris butter, the room temperature but but it doesn't go bad butter doesn't spoil it doesn't go it doesn't go rancid it takes for like weeks and weeks and weeks for butter to go rancid, and so we refrigerated because.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know the origin of it but here's the thing. Taylor Campbell: It tastes so much better at room temperature to.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's what I wanted to do now here's the thing if you don't use butter normally like if you keep the butter and the refrigerator it's been there for like six months.\nAndrew Ippolito: don't put it at room temperature, it will eventually spoil after about three or four months.\nAndrew Ippolito: Even then it might not obviously I don't know what the actual life is, but like we have a butter dish we throw butter in there, we leave it in the counter and maybe every two or three months we wash it.\nAndrew Ippolito: It doesn't go bad you think it would but it doesn't and now you suddenly have easily spreadable butter that tastes yummy.\nTaylor Campbell: What about margarine. Andrew Ippolito: What about what. Andrew Ippolito: margarine margarine margarine.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason why we refrigerate that is still spreads easily is. Andrew Ippolito: Because margarine is essentially vegetable oil that has been partially hydrogenated so it's not as saturated as fat but it's more saturated oils it's in the middle can go.\nTaylor Campbell: Bad if you left that out. Andrew Ippolito: Oh no winkle bed, but you know what it would probably become almost like a like mayonnaise quality quality to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I had to guess, if I had to guess. Jordan Russell: This has been left out for for a day now probably and it seems perfectly fine I mean it's only been a day but.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there you go there's your answer and we've empirically determine that margins okay at room temperature.\nVictoria Bloemker: I thought margarine was like fake butter. Andrew Ippolito: Well, when we say fake it is fake butter, in the sense of it's it started out as vegetable oil you I think it's usually canola oil.\nAndrew Ippolito: You guys know what. Jordan Russell: This one has an oil canola oil blend it's. Andrew Ippolito: There you go what's is there such thing as a canola leaf is or canola plan what's canola.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you want to know the goal the plant that can all comes from it's called rapeseed.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why we don't call it rapeseed oil. Andrew Ippolito: nobody's gonna buy rapeseed oil.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we call. Andrew Ippolito: It stands for, like kidney Canada something, something I forgot what the actual acronym is.\nJordan Russell: Well, it also has palm oil and this one. Andrew Ippolito: Oh that's Okay, then know.\nJordan Russell: In lactic acid. Taylor Campbell: I mean. Andrew Ippolito: I guess it isn't an inhibitor of bacteria which is a killer.\nTaylor Campbell: whales okay to eat, but apparently there's not a lot of palm and so it's being like like deforest like all the places where the palm is.\nTaylor Campbell: By the things of palm oil, even though a lot of the margin products contain it.\nTaylor Campbell: Oh that's good to know. Andrew Ippolito: yeah so just by butter and leave it at room temperature and I just have all your problems for you you're welcome.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, let's move on here. Andrew Ippolito: So there's your system trans you can watch that slide later I just skipped that okay so there's two ways we define these things there's kind of like the the chemical definition and the cooking definition.\nAndrew Ippolito: We use all the culinary definition that's what they call it so from a connery perspective, we would say fats come from animals and oils come from plans.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay chemically though text so technically.\nAndrew Ippolito: coconut oil. Andrew Ippolito: Is kind of a fat because it's a solid at room temperature right if you've ever dealt with coconut oil it's like it looks like mayonnaise like thick mayonnaise.\nAndrew Ippolito: It smells very, very cooking it you put it in your food and, if you like, coconut it's, the best thing in the world if you'd not a fan of coconut it just saturates everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: But uh that's what they they pop popcorn in the movie theaters and because that's the tastiest one coconut oil is a trans fatty acid that's why it looks like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's why you want to try to avoid it it's not super I mean like getting everybody's diet everybody decides is constantly changing on this because we're learning new things.\nAs that. Andrew Ippolito: Did you have a question Teller it looks like healing for like you had a question.\nTaylor Campbell: I was just looking at the PowerPoint. Andrew Ippolito: I was just trying. Taylor Campbell: To get better clarification on like this system trans like if there was a way that we should.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here you go. Taylor Campbell: So. Andrew Ippolito: You want to do ready, this is a. Andrew Ippolito: SIS would look like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the key is drawing this as opposed to this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it'd be doodle this just follow this exact you would normally and it's always going to put a kink in the chain, whereas this one just continues the kink or rather it continues the alternating is exactly.\nAndrew Ippolito: This. Has the king. Andrew Ippolito: The King is in assess the kink is in SS trans.\nAndrew Ippolito: Trans looks just like a saturated one.\nAndrew Ippolito: This isn't even the best picture here, because the graphic artist made these all linear like this.\nTaylor Campbell: and see ya doing this exact so yeah so. Andrew Ippolito: So the system is the one that has the the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Permanent bending it. Andrew Ippolito: And that's the one that's good to eat them right that's like yes, yes.\nAlexa Deprisco: Because that's a liquid at room temperature you got it this this this says okay.\nTaylor Campbell: The one with the kink is good to eat. Taylor Campbell: Because it's a liquid at room temperature. Andrew Ippolito: yeah it keeps it in that chaotic.\nTaylor Campbell: forum, and so it stays as a liquid and doesn't clog your arteries. Andrew Ippolito: Now that that said you'll still meant like that doesn't mean you can go around drinking vegetable oil you're still going to get fat, because your body will break that down and then it will start into your adipose tissue, which is a saturated triglyceride.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you break your food down to build up things, and so, if you eat too much your body has to store it somewhere and because that's what we got good what.\nTaylor Campbell: city trans fat is solid. Taylor Campbell: At room temperature correct yeah.\nAngela Harbeck: I have a question, so you said that we need to know the bonds and stuff for these so.\nAngela Harbeck: Right. Angela Harbeck: As. Angela Harbeck: And then i'm.\nAndrew Ippolito: Esther Esther Esther bond you call that an extra linkage know you're like acidic like goo.\nSiddiq linkage. Andrew Ippolito: Know you're one for offer one for being a one for, and then the 1616 is just a 160 know alpha beta there that's just one six.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then system trans. Andrew Ippolito: fatty acid.\nAngela Harbeck: understand the concept of saturation.\nAnd, and then obviously no closer all glycerol.\nAnd fatty acids. Andrew Ippolito: Right so that's that's just like a little list of things we just covered.\nOkay. Victoria Bloemker: I have a quick question your effort definition of a certification again.\nAndrew Ippolito: The process of building an ester bond so that would be.\nIf we had. Andrew Ippolito: This is cholesterol. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and then.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's your fatty acid. Andrew Ippolito: And so, taking the water out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then that's going to result in. Andrew Ippolito: That bond that justification.\nTaylor Campbell: And Esther bonds are part of the triglycerides you got it okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: With not just triglycerides as we'll see in a moment. Andrew Ippolito: we'll also see some fossil lip is and yeah yeah. Taylor Campbell: But yes so far.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's where it so far correct. Andrew Ippolito: All right, any other questions.\nOkay onwards. Andrew Ippolito: So here here's a very simple visual now, you can see that's going to stack neatly because it can again it was juggling, this is the worst kind of fall into this is it's easiest most comfortable positioning, whereas the oil is going to always be chaotic.\nit's like an angry octopus. Taylor Campbell: that's better for your body, yes, exactly.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's just not going to clog your arteries. Taylor Campbell: can go through better yeah okay.\nTaylor Campbell: And so. Andrew Ippolito: As far as functions go fats tend to be used in storage and protection, I have to cough sorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, my goodness hold on a second.\nAndrew Ippolito: oui i'm back alright so fast our energy storage and for protection oils are also for energy storage and protection, but they can also serve as a lubricant.\nand\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean there's there's I can think was like so an earwax your wax has oils in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: People who. Andrew Ippolito: Are of Western descent have earwax gunky and people of Eastern does tend tend to have your wax that is solid and that has to do with the differences in the liquid composition.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's that's triglycerides one too fast olympians these are easy to build because we just built them what we're gonna do ready we're going to take that glycerol molecule again.\nAndrew Ippolito: The O H O H and E O H we're going to attach to fatty acids like we did last time to make a triglyceride but for this third one we're going to change it we're going to put a phosphate group on there instead.\nAndrew Ippolito: And because these bonds here can swivel right, because these are all a single single box, this is how you would draw the fossil that been.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just very cartoony version of it just to get you the impression. Andrew Ippolito: And the phosphate group actually has an our group on it that you don't have to know but it's just it's there's a variable there so there's different possibilities.\nExcuse me. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the cartoony cartoony version of this there we take this concept here and we further reduce it in complexity, to look essentially like this, like a two year olds version of a person.\nAndrew Ippolito: A stick figure without any body or arms or anything and so we're going to call this the head.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm going to call this the the tails because their heads and tails.\nAndrew Ippolito: The head, because it has that phosphate group in it is polar.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the tales because they're hydrophobic or nonpolar.\nAndrew Ippolito: This makes the phosphor little bit of very, very special molecule all right Eric no problem.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this makes this a very special molecule it's both hydrophobic hydrophobic we call this property there's there's a word that your book uses called am fi filmic.\noops and fi.\nAndrew Ippolito: filmic yancey means both.\nAndrew Ippolito: amphibian right do you live in two places both places if you feel like there's another word that I use that I grew up with, and, for some reason, your book doesn't use it anymore and C and D pathak.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I think this is the difference between a good in a positive and negative outlook on life, and if you fill it complies it likes phyllis remember five most hydrophobic fellows Philadelphia love right means love, so it loves both water and and do you see.\nAndrew Ippolito: limits, so, in other words it's lifted and water soluble.\nAndrew Ippolito: And fi pathak means it hates both so it just depends on your perspective in life.\nAndrew Ippolito: This gives rise to a molecule that can do some really incredible things.\nAndrew Ippolito: all by itself, simply because it has both of these chemical properties in it, at the same time on two places.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can form various shapes in water so let's go over and look at that now.\nAngela Harbeck: They hate the water and what else. Angela Harbeck: limpets. Andrew Ippolito: Lip so not so, in other words the the head is soluble in water but it's not soluble and and fats and lipids that tail is not soluble in water.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it is seibel effects, so, in other words, things that are hydrophobic well like details and things that are hydrophobic like the heads.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so water will like the heads and things like oxygen gas and carbon dioxide and cholesterol things that are hydrophobic well like details.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's going to give us all these implications we're about to see now, so I want to, I want to delete this So if you want to take a screenshot or whatever, but we're going to see all this like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's you can see, if you look at the train your brain to see this right you're looking at this mess on the screen ready, I want to this is what you're going to train your eyes here, you see the glycerol.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, the phosphate group, you see the our group attached to it, you can see the ester bonds and you can see the saturated hydrocarbon chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here like a B, C D, be able to look at that be able to see that without me doodling on that screen, be able to see this this isn't just a mess anymore to you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay you're being trained to look at these things. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so i'm going to delete all that red now, and I want you to do that Okay, see the our group so find the car find the extra bond.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay use your nine do this on your own, but just to change the other find the cholesterol just circle, the glycerol with your finger okay look for the the kink in a chain of the unsaturated SIS fatty acid hey look at the phosphate group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we call this region, the head. Andrew Ippolito: Right, and this, our group can be several different things so i'll give you one example of that here.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a molecule called coleen Okay, you can see here, this is coleen coleen is if I was to doodle it out, it would be like that it's just got a nitrogen and there so it's a little positively charged okay it's got this big phosphate group it's negatively charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so this here this molecule becomes the building block of our cells membranes as well see.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here's here is again, you can see, this is coleen. Andrew Ippolito: But you don't have to know the difference is, if you take a biochemistry class sometime in the future you'll learn about the different foster lipids okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so these are the structures that we can get depending on the temperature of the environment, depending on the pH of the system.\nAndrew Ippolito: Depending on how many of them are there, so the lipid concentration and, depending on what else is in the solution, whether it's the calcium sodium mcclarty and whatever you're going to be able to form basically three different styles of higher order structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: The lip ISM or life ISM is essentially a sphere, within a sphere it's got a hollow inside.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the lip ISM is essentially the by layer but in 3D so just wrap the buyer layer after the lip his own you can think of, is a teeny teeny tiny cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, because our cell membrane just just blow that middle part up and that's a cell on.\nAndrew Ippolito: A missile is just a model layer of these were all of the hydrophobic tales are crowded on the inside of the molecule of the structure itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you throw this on water and shake it up, and this is what happens why because water in this polarity is going to be both attracted to it's going to be attracted to the heads.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so though it's kinda like a magnet game, and these are the confirmations that this system takes depending on the variables we mentioned earlier.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're going to focus for the rest of the Semester we're going to very, very rarely talk about these things will talk about things, called vessels and the cell chapter of vessel is essentially a life isn't.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay life isms are artificial things that we can put in a test tube but they're also natural building blocks of the cells trafficking within it."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 1) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/ZeHU3bpMwoA?si=cAV1N-euy1E2XOTg","chunkTitle":"Building a Fossil Lipid","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of building a fossil lipid and the formation of the cell membrane.","start":"1:31:51","end":"1:34:43","content":"Okay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, so here's how we build a fossil lifted by later, now we take a whole bunch of fossil lip is we line them up, we can see that they're going to be attracted to water remember what we did.\nAndrew Ippolito: We looked at sodium chloride, or we looked at water itself, we talked about the hydrogens being slightly positive.\nAndrew Ippolito: chloride slightly negative are very native the same concept Okay, and then the towels are just there for the ride and so there's a second layer that forms also connected to water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and that's the basic building block of a cell, this is the boundary of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: We zoom out a bit now and see that. Andrew Ippolito: And we call this thing either the plasma membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or the fossil the head by layer Andrew Ippolito: You could just say membrane and that'd be fine, this is a biological cellular membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so anything that's outside of the cell, we can just call that the extra cellular environment and anything inside the membrane itself we call that area, the inner membrane space.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then inside the cell we talk about something called the cytoplasm. Andrew Ippolito: Now i'm going to right here cytoplasm itself, you can divide into the liquid component, called the site is all know that word i'm going to use that a lot this semester psycho saw that's the liquid component.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that you can think of that as a solution of the cell. Andrew Ippolito: And the psycho skeleton.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the cytoplasm. Andrew Ippolito: has to further phases to it it's got the site is all in a silo skeleton.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, going back to the memory now waking up here if we consider just the top layer of a membrane those so so a single layer of it is called a leaflet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we have the outer leaflet the entirely foot.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they're different. Andrew Ippolito: there's things, so there are some fossil lip is that only live in the outside one and only then loved the inside one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, as will learn later when we do the membrane anytime we have sugars attached here the sugars are always on the outside, because glycol lipids and glycoproteins will get there we're not there yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you have to understand that this basic building block this concept here is the same for most all membranes and the eukaryotic cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your nucleus your endoplasmic reticulum goji apparatus license own proxies on yada yada they all have membranes that are built fundamentally like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay bacterial cells to.

Andrew Ippolito: And this is just a slide to show you the diversity of them again you don't have to study this, this is just a flavor is just fyi fyi.\nAndrew Ippolito: How to study this don't memorize these structures, but you can just see there's phosphor title coleen. Andrew Ippolito: there's finger Milan there's like ghosts fingal lipids themselves, so this is technically, not a fossil it but it's a.\nAndrew Ippolito: client goes fingal whip and you ought to know the, though, and then this is going to be our segue into the next category of lipids the cholesterol or i'm sorry the sterile sterile.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what's a sterile well. Andrew Ippolito: The class of molecules called steroids sterols are a subclass of steroids and steroids, are very unique in the lipids in that they're always formed by the same basic ring they're formed by a ring of rings this channel rather chain of rings.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if you wanted to doodle it, you would do a hexagon another hexagon and then the next axon be up here and then you end with a Pentagon like that that's the core of every steroid in existence.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And then you just let her them with bells and whistles different functional groups give them different functions so that's the difference between your estrogens and your cholesterol and your testosterone and all the other steroid hormones.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and we find these in and really now that i'm teaching Microbiology mar i'm going to clarify and mostly eukaryotic membranes prokaryotes slack stairwells and their membranes that's one of the distinctions between them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And essentially what they're doing is forming their original board, and so they reduce the ability of those spaghetti noodle fatty acid chains from moving so much they slow them down and they make the cell little more solid, so this would be like cold butter versus warm butter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Except chemically not not with a temperature change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right, so one of the here's here's another reason. Andrew Ippolito: Why, we believe that the fungus announced that a common ancestor they have this common biochemical pathway, in order to build steroids, in order to build cholesterol rather okay so plants and animals and fungus all use cholesterol.\nAndrew Ippolito: Only the episode the cons the fungus and the animals use something called Len auster all as a precursor so there's just an enzymatic pathways to build cholesterol.\nAndrew Ippolito: Plants use a different pathway. Andrew Ippolito: From cholesterol so cholesterol has two functions it's it's in the cell membrane, as we said earlier."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 1) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/ZeHU3bpMwoA?si=cAV1N-euy1E2XOTg","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Steroids","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the structure and function of steroids, including cholesterol.","start":"1:37:58","end":"1:39:47","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Plants use a different pathway.

Andrew Ippolito: It also serves as a precursor.\nAndrew Ippolito: To all other steroids.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay vitamin D to testosterone cortisol.\nAndrew Ippolito: He got astra die all. vitamin E.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's all these different molecules that come from cholesterol, based on their different biochemical pathways.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so that's classroom that starts. Andrew Ippolito: So you can see here the only difference between two radically functionally different hormones right what what makes the male gender the male gender really, really, what makes the male sex the mouse sex is testosterone concentration is much higher in the male body than the female body.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you look at the difference between testosterone and one of the estrogens Esther daya which is estrogen to or.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll see that there's there's a ketone there versus the hydroxyl group testosterone has a methyl group here that's literally the double bond missing here tiny little changes profound functional implications.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excuse me yeah.

Alexa Deprisco: Why is that little oxygen considered a ketone at the end of the testosterone not the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this functional group anybody remember what's the name of that actual functional group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good car bottle that's the car bottle functional group, and because the carbon is attached to his intern attached to additional carbons it's within the chain, and so this region, you could just Lucy Lucy call ketone.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, remember how the hides it would be at the end of it cheating.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so so, for example, let's say. Andrew Ippolito: This carbon here let's say this carbon had a double bondo at the end of it, that would be more out of the hyphen because at the end.\nAlexa Deprisco: So, like if it's coming off of the tale of a tail like the tail of hotels and how to hide that the tail of just like a ring.\nwould be a kid yeah. Andrew Ippolito: that'd be an hour to hide.

Andrew Ippolito: This would be yeah so think. Andrew Ippolito: out the hides end of the road you can't keep going.\nAndrew Ippolito: ketone is along the way.\nOkay, all right. Andrew Ippolito: And so what cholesterol does in the membrane I stole this from a review Article that was published, like last two or three years ago.\nAndrew Ippolito: You don't have to you don't have to know the details here, this is shop talk the ripple phase and pre transition don't worry about it, what I want you to focus on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the difference between these two States here okay so on the left hand side, you can see that the fossil lip is are very evenly ordered and what we talked about earlier with butter that leads to a solid right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, this would be like in a very cold temperature the cells membrane would become rigid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, to heat it up too much now look at the right hand side it's going to be very, very disorder, to be more fluid like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now the reason why this matters to us, I haven't mentioned this part yet if this is a cartoony version of a memory we're going to see very shortly, that there are proteins embedded in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those proteins can diffuse across this like a boat on the water they're not locked in place, and in fact the foss Phillip is themselves can also move.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of a whole bunch of people in a very crowded place, they can still move the people themselves can move within the crowd right.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what the festival that you're doing and so there's a lot of movement here lots of movement and there's really at this point there's no movement.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so no movement and your cell dies, because it can do, but it's got to do too much movement in the south dots because everything falls apart, and so what cholesterol does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is it allows a maintenance of a homeostatic goldilocks location where it's just fluid enough but not too fluid and just solid enough but not too solid okay so by adding and taking away cholesterol onto the membrane this can modulate the fluidity of it.\nAngela Harbeck: So these like the fossil lifted by layer that's like the membrane of the cell.\nAngela Harbeck: Correct okay. Andrew Ippolito: And it's also the membrane that we see in the nucleus, and all the other organelles we're talking about next chapter six next chapter.\nOkay. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Chapter seven is all about the memory so we'll revisit all this in more detail later for now it's just enough to understand the role of that cholesterol place.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here it is again, you can see it it's sticks in there it's slides in there and it basically serves as a little bouncer or a little stabilizing board it prevents the phosphor liquid fatty acid chains from moving too much.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And that's that that's that's the roots, you know waxes.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you understand so here don't look at the slide just look at me for a second so if we go back to triglyceride the idea here.\nOf. Andrew Ippolito: This molecule right so remember glycerol is a three carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alcohol. Andrew Ippolito: And these fatty acids are, I think, was like what 16 to 22 carbons long.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's triglyceride So if I was to draw a triglyceride as a cartoony version let's just make it this rectangle here.\nAndrew Ippolito: To scale to waxes because now you're going to see all of waxes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a long chain alcohol. Andrew Ippolito: Instead of go off instead of it being a three carbon alcohol like cholesterol let's just make it like imagine a ridiculously long strange version of a capital E.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay long chain alcohol and then.\nAndrew Ippolito: very long. Andrew Ippolito: fatty acids.\nsaturated ones.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so this molecule that's what a wax is.\ngonna be like. Andrew Ippolito: This in terms of how big it is and here's my stupid joke, you could say that waxes are essentially triglycerides on steroids.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's funnier when I said it by accident that one time.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it's it's true waxes are basically triglycerides on steroids."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 1) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/ZeHU3bpMwoA?si=cAV1N-euy1E2XOTg","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Proteins","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces proteins as the most abundant and diverse molecules in cells.","start":"1:56:33","end":"2:00:00","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Alright i'm back.

Andrew Ippolito: All right, so proteins i'm just going to wait for proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: First of all, the word protein comes from the word pro Dios which means first our first place.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea is when we first discovered these. productions there's an eye on their produce.\nI think that's no no i'm gonna cheat will use my PowerPoint.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh produce produce it's a Greek word produce first first place when we first discovered these we realized that most of the stuff in a cell is this and other words 50% of the cells mass is protein right that's just enormous So these are the most abundant.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the most diverse of anything we're going to talk about this semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: Understanding proteins right so so you spending a little extra time on these will benefit you because you'll be able to understand so much about what's going on in the world.\nAndrew Ippolito: Everything from coronavirus to cancer therapy to immunotherapy to everything proteins just do all the work of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Jordan, yes that's a dumb question you didn't know the answer.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or did you then it's done wish.\nJordan Russell: More than I looked at it and I saw that, like the three summers were fructose glucose in lactose I was thinking, I was dumb question, of course, we need to do that yeah."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 1) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/ZeHU3bpMwoA?si=cAV1N-euy1E2XOTg","chunkTitle":"Amino Acids and Peptide Bonds","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the structure of amino acids and the formation of peptide bonds.","start":"2:00:00","end":"2:10:53","content":"Jordan Russell: More than I looked at it and I saw that, like the three summers were fructose glucose in lactose I was thinking, I was dumb question, of course, we need to do that yeah.\nJordan Russell: You don't think each other. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so what we're going to do here is we're gonna.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to gloss over the function of these because they do everything you can mean that slide they're involved in everything I want to get to building them and understanding them physically.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they are the traditional marmor polymer configuration, just like the sugars and and, just like the nucleic acids will be okay, the monomers termed and amino acid so we're going to talk about those first the polymer is called a poly peptide.\nactually use the undo button here. peptide. Andrew Ippolito: And as we're going to see.\nAndrew Ippolito: poly peptides one or more of these.\nAndrew Ippolito: folded up into a sheep.\nAndrew Ippolito: lead to what we call a protein. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Most books don't make this distinction, and so I think it's the state of perpetual confusion poly peptide is nothing more and nothing less than a chain of amino acids bound together a protein is a functional thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: It has a form and function, and it can be built from one poly peptide or multiple ones I want that's where we're going to get to today.\nAndrew Ippolito: So first let's focus on amino acids. Andrew Ippolito: what's an amino acids and amino acid is.\nAndrew Ippolito: A very simple molecule that consists of an alpha carbon right sorry i'll draw this.\nBig. Andrew Ippolito: get a little further down here, and I can always scroll up later, but I want to hear.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon and then it has. Andrew Ippolito: What we're just calling our group or just our okay and we're going to call that you can literally call out the our group, if you want, but most times you'll call this the side chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: In addition, and I always want you to draw this the right way on the left side there is an amino group and each to.\nesteem, you know group. Andrew Ippolito: And then on the right hand side.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a car buck silicon group, which consists of a carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Double bound to an oxygen single bound to an O h. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so this is the draw this little thinner here the car box.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you want to call it a carb oxalic acid.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so you can see here, this is the cool part, this is what makes these so crazy and awesome all of the chemical properties we've talked about up to this point.\nAndrew Ippolito: hydrophobic and hydrophobic acidic and alkaline functional and structural phosphorylation methylation self hydro, all of the chemistry we've talked about.\nAndrew Ippolito: can be represented within the 20 different amino acids that make up all of life's proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so all amino acids have this common structure, plus to our group okay so within life, and this is the crazy part there's an infinite we can just make up our we can make whatever we want there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every single cell on this planet uses only 20 and they're all the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, once we discovered that right Darwin would have probably been jumping around enjoy.\nAndrew Ippolito: He there was no way Darwin could have predicted any of this he just came up with this general concept everything we discover after that just keeps confirming this idea of common ancestry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so let me keep the colors the same here there are 20 of these.\n20 different. Sites chains.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they fall into different categories there's a. Andrew Ippolito: let's say there's a cynic ones there's alkaline ones.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's hydrophobic ones. Andrew Ippolito: there's Hydra filet.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's big ones and little ones. Andrew Ippolito: Right so like big chains or one that's just hydrogen.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: there's polar. Andrew Ippolito: ones, so you can say polar nonpolar you know what.\nAndrew Ippolito: Technically, you could put polar an extra hydrophobic. And nonpolar next hydrophobic.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so Basically, this is, this is the cells chemical toolbox.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: You are not responsible for knowing all of the names and the structures and whatnot just be aware that there are 20 of them and they bought these various categories.\nAndrew Ippolito: It might be useful to get to know a few of the important ones i'll talk about them later for now that's good enough what we're going to do now is start to build the bonds between them and build the poly pepped up it's Okay, so what we're going to do i'm going to scroll down here again.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'm going to redraw one of them all in one color let's make it blue alright so here.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm going to draw another one actually know what.\ngoing to do this. Andrew Ippolito: But here's the problem.\nhere's the problem. Andrew Ippolito: This is technically down here remember, we talked about in in cellulose the glucose went every other one upside down right side up it's the same thing with these so they don't form the natural HALO sees either, these are all flat, so what i'm going to do here is just.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah i'm just going to redraw this with a different i'll do a different color just use a green.\nApril Neeld: yeah God i'm so I pronounce the notes that you have on canvas and it says and for Jesus has over 100,000 identified is that just for proteins and then our groups is 20.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah so there's 20,000 or there's like 100,000 different proteins discovered that have names and functions.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, I just read through this but not see it's upside down now that's it.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: But notice how I align them notice how I put the car box silica group right next to the amino group Those are the two they're going to react here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reaction is going to occur, right here there's your dehydration synthesis again.\nthere's a oh H and H Andrew Ippolito: Just like the Alpha beta one fours and the one sixes and sugars, the same exact concept here, so what we're gonna do is we're going to take this pair of molecules this pair of amino acids and we are going to remove water from the system.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then what we're going to the bond we're gonna build is going to be between this carbon and nitrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: So i'm going to redraw this now and you'll see, though the formed bond here okay so let's do the left hand side there's the out there close the Alpha carbon the middle one okay there's a side chain.\nhere's the amino group. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now we're going to do this carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you see has got the double see the car bottling group there the double bond oh i'm going to point this down like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm going to come up like this. Andrew Ippolito: And that's the nitrogen from the other one.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the nitrogen the amino group of the second amino acid i'm going to draw a hydrogen going up here.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's the Alpha carbon of the second amino acid. Andrew Ippolito: The our group pointing down.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then here is. Andrew Ippolito: The carb oxalic group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what you're seeing here is called a peptide bond, and this molecule that we just drew formerly is called a boy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is formerly called. Andrew Ippolito: A di peptide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And let me highlight for you now.\nAndrew Ippolito: This right here, that is called.\nAndrew Ippolito: The peptide bond.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's special just like water, do you see, they see the polarity there notice that that double bond oxygen which loves electrons this is going to be slightly negative and amino the nitrogen nitrogen is basic like it's a little positive, and so this side is going to be slightly positive.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a polar Kobe ella bond there, so the peptide bond is polar Kobe.\nAndrew Ippolito: which gives us all sorts of interesting consequences.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, any questions.\nOkay. Taylor Campbell: So you want us to be able to identify this not necessary.\nTaylor Campbell: Yes, you got it. Andrew Ippolito: Just be able to if I show you i'm going to show you I tell you right now that test is going to have this this picture, with a whole bunch of different molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's going to be a list of molecule names and you're going to have to put a name to a face right so each one of the molecules i'll have a letter.\nTaylor Campbell: next to it. Andrew Ippolito: And then i'll ask you what's this what's that what's this it'll be like a matching."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 1) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/ZeHU3bpMwoA?si=cAV1N-euy1E2XOTg","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Amino Acids","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the concept of amino acids and their importance in biological systems.

Taylor Campbell: This wasn't this truth, even though it's sort of part of what that claim is saying it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not so so what the. Andrew Ippolito: What Louis Pasteur disproved. Andrew Ippolito: This notion of spontaneous generation.\nAndrew Ippolito: idea sorry. Taylor Campbell: had to do with life. Andrew Ippolito: had to do with today's life, right now, at this moment, where we have this complexity of eukaryotic cells in mice in everything in between.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea was originally I mean this This makes sense right bacteria are really, really primitive and they're very, very simple.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, it stands to reason that you can just mix a bunch of chemicals together and eventually they'll just make a cell and they believe that that was a common thing that happened and that's where.\nAndrew Ippolito: spoilage came from like beer and wine being spoiled or or my sauce oh did that eventually we realized that no cells are way too complicated to just.\nAndrew Ippolito: fall together like that all the time, and what Louis pastor showed was when things are contaminated they're getting contaminate from the air that there's micro organisms and so that's what eventually.\nAndrew Ippolito: gave rise to the germ theory of disease, but the concept that life arose from this combination of been organic or I keep saying inorganic this dead material.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you rewind time three and a half billion years early earth reducing environment and that's what, if you read about the Uri Miller experiment.\nAndrew Ippolito: that'll teach you about that that's where they put a bunch of simple stuff into a bunch of test tubes that were close to the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then added energy to it and found, you know as the months went by they started getting more and more complex organic molecules okay so so that so instead of saying spontaneous generation we've termed that a bio genesis to distinguish it from spontaneous.\nAndrew Ippolito: Great question. Taylor Campbell: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Back to proteins we. Alexa Deprisco: Can I just backtrack first hot stuck in there.\nAlexa Deprisco: yeah I saw electric protein that you drew do you think there's any correlation there because there's like you circle, the nh three which could be like ammonia and then like the CO2 is like kind of like.\nAlexa Deprisco: How you're saying like these, I guess, early earth elements that like defined what we are.\nAlexa Deprisco: Oh. Andrew Ippolito: yeah I mean, so the the current belief is that the the building blocks of life were seated on earth, there was this 500 million year period of constant bombardment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in that bombardment we got a lot of water, but we also got this stuff, and so there were thinking of it like a jumpstart we cut some corners, instead of having to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have amino acids form themselves spontaneously on earth, they work they came prefabricated from the cosmos that's the idea and there's this this that whole theory is called panspermia.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is all wonderful interesting stuff that has nothing to do with evolution. Andrew Ippolito: This has to do with the origin of life there's books written on the subject, you can go to websites and blogs, if you like this stuff Google panspermia and.\nAndrew Ippolito: And dig into the Uri geller experiments it's really interesting stuff.

Andrew Ippolito: here's the Alpha carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's a car bucks a lead carbon. And here's the amino group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I want you to be able to see that. Andrew Ippolito: So this right here is the our group, even though it's just a plain old hydrogen you see there's two hydrogens here right all the amino acids have.\nAndrew Ippolito: The hydrogen bound to them on their alpha carbon Okay, but glycine is the simplest amino acid, and this is the one we find in the cosmos most commonly in the stardust is just a hydrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, if you look at this chart here. Andrew Ippolito: i'm going to highlight for you that's way too thick i'm going to highlight for you here the side chains, so you can see, get to see them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so understand the core of the amino acids always the same to here i'll highlight the core of the amino acids in orange here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's the core there's the amino group the Alpha carbon and the carb oxalic group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, there are a few special cases as that last slide showed the biggest one that you can look at as proline proteins, a special amino acid because it's our group it side chain wraps back around and interact with the amino group.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see it going like this, so it actually it forms a ring here, the consequence of this is that what proline does is it puts kinks in the chain, like a double bond in a fatty acid."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 1) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/ZeHU3bpMwoA?si=cAV1N-euy1E2XOTg","chunkTitle":"Tertiary Structure of Proteins","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the tertiary structure of proteins, where the secondary structures fold and interact to form a three-dimensional conformation.","start":"2:26:11","end":"2:27:39","content":"Andrew Ippolito: You can see it going like this, so it actually it forms a ring here, the consequence of this is that what proline does is it puts kinks in the chain, like a double bond in a fatty acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words, if this is the poly peptide chain, you can put a hard angle in there, that would be proline.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you would see that this is a structurally important amino acid, not a chemically important or functionally important Okay, so if you want to build a protein in 3D printing would be important.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so i'm going to say oops I Double Click to that brought me to 100% sorry, let me go all the way to 500 and then back out to to something.\nAbout there.

And I want to see.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think today, we were supposed to completely finished this which would have included the amino acid nucleic acids.\ninstead.\nAndrew Ippolito: It looks like we've got two days of cells and then the exam. Okay, I could totally do that.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're not behind so that's good. Andrew Ippolito: This is just a guide to help keep us on track as long as we get through cells were and we finished exam one we're good so where we are today i'm looking at the schedule, when the 10th.\nAndrew Ippolito: We finished, it said chapter 5.4 to the end that includes nucleic acids, which we did not cover here, and then on Monday we're supposed to start cells, so instead what we're gonna do on Monday.\nIs we're going to finish. Andrew Ippolito: Chapter five and we're going to focus on nucleic acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we're gonna start Chapter six cells.\nVictoria Bloemker: We have unit tests, or do we just have like the quizzes. Andrew Ippolito: We have the so next Friday is your first big test the first test right so so Wednesday of next week, we will finish cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then Friday of next week so make sure your schedules are cleared, we have our first test test or exam one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's going to include Chapter one three Chapter six and then we'll also include that little handout on knowledge and science.\nTaylor Campbell: When like what time on Friday. Andrew Ippolito: i'm going to start the ELENA start officially at 10 o'clock just like you guys start normally.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, i'm going to invite the afternoon class they could come in in the morning and take it to and then i'll just keep.\nAndrew Ippolito: practicing it until there are no more students left to take the exam if you work on Friday and you haven't planned ahead to take off if you could.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you have a conflict just let me know in zoom chat privately and all accommodate you, I am aware of the fact that you did not sign up for a Friday class.\nAndrew Ippolito: But as we discussed all the way back on day one, this is giving you a little bit more time to study and get ahead of the game, so to speak, and.\nAndrew Ippolito: And everybody seemed to want to do that, so if you have a conflict, I will be happy to accommodate you, you have been means having to take it on Saturday or Sunday.\nAndrew Ippolito: The only excuse for, that is, if you have a conflicting work schedule that you can't get out of it's not a convenience thing like I don't feel like taking it Friday it's I can't physically take it Friday, because I have work that I can't get out of.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so do me a favor look look at the rest of the schedule for the Semester.

Andrew Ippolito: Sorry, I didn't.\nDanuta Despagne: print for it, or is it going to be in the computer. Andrew Ippolito: Do you have to put.\nDanuta Despagne: Some classes by the email the paper, and then we print it, it will take it like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh no, no, no, your test will be on canvas. Danuta Despagne: and Andrew Ippolito: The way we're going to do this is you're going to have to set your phone up you're going to connect to the meeting on your phone.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you're going to set your phone up in the room, so that I can see you very clearly. Andrew Ippolito: So that I don't see anybody, you know pulling out papers or books or whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to so maybe figure that out today, so that you don't stress about it on Friday, because some students really struggle with figuring out where to put their phones and I had some students put their phone behind them where all I see is like.\nAndrew Ippolito: their shoulders and i'm not suggesting they're cheating, but if they had a book on their lap and they were just referencing it the whole time I would wouldn't have been able to tell so and I had to interrupt their test and be like I can't see you.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean it's kinda like being in the classroom and like turning around from me and huddling like that'd be a little suspicious in your life.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you want to set yourself up where the cameras behind you at about 45 degrees on on top of something looking down, so I see your screen, I see you, I see your keyboard.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you want to do a dry run on that, next Monday, just so you can set it up, we can do that if you want, so that when the time comes, you can just take a test so speaking of test we got i'm looking at the schedule here.\nexam one is the 19th the 19th. Victoria Bloemker: exam to is march 26.\nexam. Three is may alarm sorry April 16.\nAnd then exam for is may 7.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the final is may 14 which all you guys have a whole week there that's great this jump here that you're lucky it doesn't always work out that way, sometimes you have your test on like Monday.\nVictoria Bloemker: Excuse me, and then the final like three days later, I have a quick question um so for this are we actually able to like take our time on it and read each like question by ourselves.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or do you yes yeah oh yeah yeah no i'm not reading through it. Andrew Ippolito: you're gonna have the freedom to bust through it yeah okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there'll be a timer. Andrew Ippolito: And the time limit is going to be, as a rule of thumb about a minute, a question.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and you'll be able to see multiple questions at the same time i'll unlock it that way, so I can be one question at a time i'm also gonna not gonna lock the question so that once you answer a question you can't go back to it because i'm.\nVictoria Bloemker: Drinking I can see you. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so the alternative to this is tighter time locking questions, one question at a time.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, like if your camera is not set up that way that would have to be how I did it and I don't want to do that to you so i'd rather give you that comfort comfort.\nAndrew Ippolito: of being able to kind of go around your test and answer them and your own otter and go back and check your answers and there'll be a timer, but you can hide the timer to there's a little bit you can just hide timer so you don't just see it ticking away driving you crazy okay.\nVictoria Bloemker: I think. Jordan Russell: Emily how many questions should we expect on the test. Andrew Ippolito: All of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, Jordan that's that's the most common question I get and my answer is always less than 200.\nJordan Russell: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So we mean it could be 190 questions yeah i'm not gonna do that to you, but I don't know, and the reason why I don't have a definitive answer is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every semester I tweak it a little bit so here's the real answer more than 50 fewer than 80.\nJordan Russell: Okay, OK. Andrew Ippolito: OK so it's it'll it'll take you about two hours or so, to get through.\nAndrew Ippolito: The other reason I can't answer, that is, I do sometimes I do matching and, like the matching might be 10 questions, but really each a question right there just 10 slots and that goes away faster than 10 national multiple choice questions I have a paragraph so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there'll be some mapping there'll be some multiple choice i'll probably i'm not going to do the multiple multiple choice, those are just nightmares at this point in the system.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, after the test when you're finished, you know you can log off and go and once every single student every single student has taken a test, including the ones that campus are working so whenever after that happens.\nAndrew Ippolito: I then go into the system, I dump all the data in excel and I look for questions that were terrible there's always a little set of questions that everybody gets wrong, and then I throw those in the way I do that as I add up the number of questions that I decided I didn't want to count.\nJordan Russell: And then I come up with some percentage from that. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so if there were 78 questions and there were seven I didn't like I would do seven divided by 70 and get some you know percentage, and then I would go in and add that to everybody score.\nAndrew Ippolito: So your final score don't freak out if it's a little lower than you expect that's going to go up I adjust them it's not a curve I just throw out the bad questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: It might be there's a curve a curve, is when I take the average. Andrew Ippolito: Right let's say that everybody got a.\n47. Andrew Ippolito: I say every single student got a 47.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's see. Andrew Ippolito: that's that's a curve, is where you take the average I mean you calculate the standard deviation so let's say you guys know you guys still see my screen right i'll teach about cursor that's kind of fun so let's say that the spread was about curve.\nAndrew Ippolito: right we call this a normal distribution. Andrew Ippolito: The average person got this grid and we call that a see.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, the standard deviation is a measure of how spread across the data is so, in other words let's say that everybody got about the same score.\nAndrew Ippolito: That would look like this, whereas let's say that everybody got a very different score it would look like this see that spread so standard deviation as a measure of how spread apart, it is so you do is you calculate the average you calculate the standard deviation and then you do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: You go up or down one standard deviation and that's your be in your D you go up another standard deviation and that's your a and your F and that's why we have.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's BBC def I don't know why it's just make that in a I don't know because F means fail and they needed to know I don't know alright, so I don't do this, this is curving and that way let's say that the average was.\nAndrew Ippolito: A 52% with a standard deviation of 7%. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so I would say, so I would set it in a system where, if you got a 52 to a 50 so be would be what are 59% if you got a 59 on the test you get a B.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a curve I don't do any of this, what I do is I say out of these 75 questions I hated seven of them right so seven out of 75 i'm making this up is like whatever 4.2%, and so I just go into the system, I just add 4.2% everybody's great I call it an adjustment, the difficulty adjustment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you see how that's fundamentally different like this doing this is for honestly it's for people who are lazy to teach."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 1) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/ZeHU3bpMwoA?si=cAV1N-euy1E2XOTg","chunkTitle":"Chapter Organization and Clarification","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito clarifies the organization of the chapters in the course material and addresses a specific confusion regarding Chapter 4B.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so so like I remember years and years ago when I still cared a little bit about rate my Professor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some kid wrote in there, it from makkah I was a kid it was like some 18 year old that was always asking it just you know you have your annoying students occasionally.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they were just one of those ones that like they were just all they cared about was there a grid right and they stick they compliment he he curves this tests like I don't my tests.\nAndrew Ippolito: Part of the other reason for that is the other faculty. Andrew Ippolito: When they heard that I curve test or like you can curve these tests these students are going to be nurses you don't want a nurse like killing people because they don't know what you don't want to send a person into anatomy physiology the class.\nAndrew Ippolito: With a see in your class that really didn't earn a senior class if you curbed right, so these were these were pre nursing students.\nAndrew Ippolito: And at Monaco, in order to get into a MP, you had to take the general biology class 121 over there.\nAndrew Ippolito: which was like a mixed majors class, it was like not quite bio one on one here, but not what you guys are doing you guys are majors majors biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if I curved my tests in that non majors class and everybody got their see even if they didn't know biology they then subsequently went to take bio one, at one and bomb it and then they'd be take it and bombing because they really shouldn't have been there, to begin with.\nJordan Russell: And i'm sorry to interrupt. Andrew Ippolito: me too. Jordan Russell: I gotta I gotta go, but I have one question.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah good. Jordan Russell: i'm weird does. Jordan Russell: Like it's Chapter four be technically Chapter five.\nAndrew Ippolito: So three ready three is water and pH for is generic organic chemistry carbon functional groups skeletons carbon skeleton Chapter five biological macro molecules.\nJordan Russell: The case of Chapter four B is. Andrew Ippolito: Also it's lecture lecture for be.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'm sorry I Maybe I should rename all these systemically so that it's not as confusing my original lecture was Chapter four.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that had the carbon stuff in it as an introduction and then we started with limpets carbohydrates, your book made a new chapter, and so I just caught my Chapter four and half and I call the day MB.\nJordan Russell: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: that's the only time in the Semester that that'll be confusing.\nJordan Russell: Because when he says, like Chapter six is next I was like well. Andrew Ippolito: where's Chapter five.\nJordan Russell: I was like where's Chapter five. Andrew Ippolito: yeah well today we almost but not quite finished.\nOkay. Jordan Russell: six.

Andrew Ippolito: This this blows everybody's mind when they first learned it and that idea that everything on earth that lives, the bacteria, they are cans and then all the Multi select the plants, the animals in the fungus the medicine medicine medicine.\nAndrew Ippolito: start to get to know that word but that's that's the animal kingdom. Andrew Ippolito: that's just the actual technical term for the animal kingdom, as you guys being budding biologists that you are, you should know that medicine oh and means animal.\nAndrew Ippolito: So all of these things use exactly the same 20 amino acids mind blown right, I mean there's not a separate set of 20 for the bacteria, or even two or three different they're literally, all the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, then we learned about how to build peptide bonds, we saw the carb oxalic group of one. Andrew Ippolito: Of the amino acids interacting with the peptide with the amino group of the next one right, so if you're looking at this figure here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is one amino acid, this is the other amino acid and. Andrew Ippolito: Remember the dehydration reaction and so here it is we're going to take a nation and all each one, this is one monitor this is one monitor we're going to rip an hmo each off we're going to get water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right we're going to make water and then we're going to synthesize the bond between the things that lost the water and that right here is the peptide bond, this is a polar bond slightly negative slightly positive and that's going to lead to hydrogen bonding throughout the chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there it is, and then we call this thing here a di peptide right there's di peptides there's try peptides there's Tetra peptides.\nAndrew Ippolito: all the way up to what we say all ago peptide and all ago peptide just means up to about 12 or so and then pass that we have poly peptide and that's where we start talking now about protein structure Okay, so this is how proteins work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Every protein starts as at least one chain of amino acids and we'll call this chain here, this is a poly peptide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright it's important to know that at the very end here if we looked at this amino acid it we zoomed all the way into it, we would see that, on this side of it would be a free and available amino group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then, on the other side, this would be a free and available carb oxalic group, and so we call this side the N terminus.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we call this side over here the C terminus.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, and you see that order the end on the left and the see on the right that's the Convention we use when we're talking about proteins that's just we had to pick one how to pick a side right, and so we picked the side, where, when we build it it goes this way."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Amino Acids and Protein Structure","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the different types of amino acids and their role in protein structure.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you notice that each one of these has a name those are the you know various 20 amino acids, that you don't have to memorize revealing so you should also know this, that all the amino acids have their full name like searing.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have a three letter code like Sir, and they have a one letter abbreviation and this one letter abbreviation does not always correlate to their actual name, for example, a trip to fan boy trip.\nAndrew Ippolito: trip to fan, which is T our P is w.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when you get into biochemical to memorize all this stuff your Professor will probably tell you just say this in the same way that elmer flood would say it you guys know who elmer flood was from bugs bunny Okay, the old bugs bunny cartoons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right wabbits Twitter fan w.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe that's why they picked it who knows. Jordan Russell: When that's now. Andrew Ippolito: that's probably not even sure we could look it up, but that's.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, so not all of them are one to one and i'm getting into a really weird tangent right now stop doing that, so what you're seeing here this chain of amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call this the primary sequence right, this is the protein sequence, we talk about sequencing jeans and sequencing proteins that's the sequence for the protein right, so we call this the primary sequence.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, you you're both calls it structure, so you could say primary structure, I hate that phrase because there's no structure here is just a sequence but.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is secondary structure and tertiary structure so just to keep it consistent, we can see the primary structure the secondary structure, etc.\nAngela Harbeck: it's not a structure. Andrew Ippolito: So the primary structure is a. Andrew Ippolito: literal sequence of amino acids, we can read it from left to right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so it would be like in this one be like be Ay Ay s l s P l a it's such like a it's like a it's like a big run on English word.\nAndrew Ippolito: The average human protein has about 300 amino acids, to give you a context of how many there are.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so here's what we do now we're gonna see this this it looks like a you know Pearl necklace.\nAll these. Andrew Ippolito: Most important toy of the Semester is the one that teaches.\nAndrew Ippolito: right here okay I showed you did I show you guys this last week yeah I showed you so here we're basically we're gonna fold it up into 3D.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so i'm going to show you how we get here, so we go from we call this the primary we call this the tertiary we're going to jump the secondary right now Okay, so the overall shape of that one folded up poly peptide that folded up shape we call it the tertiary tertiary.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And again that's a single poly peptide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Somewhere in there let's look at this carefully okay see right here so it's like the open ended arrow that's probably the C terminus and then.\nAndrew Ippolito: There there's the other one right so there's an internist and a C terminus Those are just thinking that was just folded up you know metal.\nfolded up metal. Andrew Ippolito: coils like Oh, take a pipe cleaner and bend it around like that they're still going to be to end somewhere all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's that's that's the tertiary so. Andrew Ippolito: Now let's talk about with the word proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: A protein is either one or more than one folded up poly peptides.\nAndrew Ippolito: That have a function right and why see more than one we can be talking about to poly peptides interacting with each other right so here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Look at my toys for a second here is one folded up poly peptide here's another folded up holly peptide and they stick together, and now this thing this thing here now has some job so we'll call this thing right here, oh protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so a single poly peptide folded up, we would call this a moto America protein, you can also call this a tertiary protein, because it has a 3D it has it only goes up to level three of the.\nAndrew Ippolito: The different echelons of folding right if it is a protein that has multiple pieces to it right so watch the watch this here's a monolithic protein here's another.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's exactly the same let's say, these are exactly the same, and they interact homo because they're the same dimer so you call this a hormone dynamic protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can also refer to this and all the others up here as quadrant dairy proteins okay so let's introduce that here quad ternary, and this is the last layer of structure."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Quaternary Structure and Protein Aggregation","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses quaternary structure, which involves multiple folded polypeptides interacting with each other.

Andrew Ippolito: that's when you have multiple.\nAndrew Ippolito: poly peptides that are folded up right and so at this at this point, if you have a question or a protein like hemoglobin.\nAndrew Ippolito: You would call these The sub units. Andrew Ippolito: Because they don't have their own function by themselves they're a piece to something bigger.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so context is everything here. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so you would roughly divided proteins into tertiary proteins in quadrant a.\nAndrew Ippolito: quadrant a proteins can be two things, or more than two things, and so you can call them things like all the way up to multi metric.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so try merrick quad turmeric or Tetra merrick depending on who's talking Liga merrick.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then hormone hetero. Andrew Ippolito: homo if they're all the same pieces if they're all the same peptide i'm sorry poly peptide hetero they're made out of multiple ones, thank you so let's do hemoglobin as a simple example hemoglobin consists of there's two genes that make to poly peptides So these are the genes.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're gonna make poly peptides and there's alpha. Andrew Ippolito: globe in.\nAndrew Ippolito: And beta globe. Andrew Ippolito: globe and we used to do not want when we start studying blood we've done all these different proteins and blood we call them Globe things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are globulin okay so alpha globulin folds up into some fancy 3D structure and so does the beta Okay, and then what happens is to have these.\nAndrew Ippolito: and two of these come together and form this hetero Tetra American complex call that we call hemoglobin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we don't call that that's not a plural thing that's one thing that that is one molecule of hemoglobin or one protein, of the one molecule so.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's one thing, and so we call that our quality protein okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so this tertiary structures your raw 3D shape now it's talking about secondary structure, this is the bond, I think a lot of students struggle with but it's really it's really simple.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you take that overall 3D shape and you zoom into some regions of it, where there's something interesting there some structural motif that's the idea.\nAndrew Ippolito: We will see repeating motifs over and over, just like in a really complicated piece of music there's different motifs that pop up that sound familiar little chunks of music that's get scattered throughout.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right or if you ever watched a big epic movie that has a really good. Andrew Ippolito: Music score to it like Star Wars, you know, whenever Luke skywalker comes up on the screen he's got his own theme song right so you'd say that's looks motif and lay his motif right so there's two basic motifs that all all proteins have most common one is called the Alpha helix.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is essentially one of the key building blocks to to protein, so the point where, when you doodle proteins, you can do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can just put a bunch of Ulysses together and there's a protein Okay, and then you have something called the beta sheet which here, I have this little actually made one I have a pamphlet, for you know, asking the beta pleaded sheet literally looks like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: In 3D and actually I have it right here, you can see here, so these oh wow look at that I just that's so cool just confused zoom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can see very clearly, there is the that dark line I drew you can see, the little lines in between it those are hydrogen bonds between the poly peptide chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're going to take this you and you can even if we started up here let's say this is the end of this, the N terminus you can imagine me rattling off the different amino acids that make this up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then because of whatever their nature is there's hydrogen bonds between them and then they do this watch this, then they do this they form a sheet and we call this thing of being depleted.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And those are the two I wanted to know. Andrew Ippolito: There are other more exotic motifs like sink fingers and lucene zippers we find those and proteins go transcription factors, but you don't have to know that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so you can see here so here's the leucine zip or the lucien zipper is found in proteins called transcription factors that bind to DNA directly and you can see that these proteins buying literally bind to DNA.\nIn a sequence specific matter. Andrew Ippolito: And then the zinc finger, you can see, actually use the zinc guy on there.\nAndrew Ippolito: But again, you don't you don't need to fill in all that. Andrew Ippolito: there's a finger itself consists of an alpha helix in the beta sheet, you can so everything can be pretty much divided the Alpha helix is everywhere, I mean you can see, even here in the lucene zipper that is an alpha helix right there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so these are just these are the sub structures that when when you put them all together, you build up into the tertiary okay there's a big there's depleted seat again.\nalright. Andrew Ippolito: So your primary structure your amino acid sequence and and unraveled poly peptide all the way up to the question or a structure where you have to have more folded up polly peptides and tracking.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's hemoglobin you can see, the two alpha subunits and the two beta so.\nAndrew Ippolito: We call that heterosexual. Andrew Ippolito: don't worry about what he means the team is a carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: structure it looks kind of like a steroids, and not it's got a bunch of cleaner carbon rings in it and that's where oxygen bonds and that's where iron is and we're not going to go into that level of detail here.\nAlexa Deprisco: Excuse me. yeah. Alexa Deprisco: So hetero Tetra America is referring to, like four different components, because it's like head around this room petrol.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this is telling hetero touch them or tells us that this molecule has different components hetero meaning they're different so you got alphas and betas.\nAndrew Ippolito: And Tetra merrick meaning, we got four, so the word itself this doesn't tell us that there's two alphas and betas this just tells us there's multiple things and they're different so there could be three alphas and one beta.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know it's not it's not usually how things work but there's so this doesn't tell you everything it's still it's just more specific than saying there's a protein.\nAlexa Deprisco: Okay, so like an umbrella term that like. Alexa Deprisco: yeah there's different things going on, but like not specifically yes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's you can say hetero touch America. Andrew Ippolito: So, like okay let's say the most gentle hey look that's a thing, what is that thing this thing is a protein okay well we'll kind of protein is it it's a header it's a.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a question or a protein what kind of cautionary protein is it all right fine it's a hetero Tetra americ protein okay well, what are the building blocks of well there's two alphas and betas and you can just keep going from there, so that's the level of detail, you get.\nJulia Lakchin: So on the test or you will you like, give us like a picture of that and we have to say that that's hetero touch America."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Protein Folding and Self-Hydro Bridge","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of protein folding and the role of self-hydro bridges (disulfide bonds) in stabilizing protein structure.

Julia Lakchin: Protein is. Andrew Ippolito: be somewhat like when I say had our controller.\nAndrew Ippolito: Understand it's just got multiple pieces to it that are that and the key there is ready, if I pull if this is a quad ternary protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that what that means is if I pull these two things apart, they still have their intact tertiary structures right, these are still fully intact they're just not stuck together doing their job right so so there's quadrant Harry.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's tertiary. Andrew Ippolito: And then, if we started pulling us apart will call DNA cheering we can tell if there's an alpha helix is a beta sheet, all the way to the point where we can.\nAndrew Ippolito: pull this apart and say okay there's the end terminus there are, and we can start reading the individual amino acids are primary so primary, secondary.\nAndrew Ippolito: tertiary coronary.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does that help. Andrew Ippolito: Alright cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now I can finally teach you a little bit about the self hydro bridge or the self hydro. Andrew Ippolito: functional group that we only touched on lightly, when we first learned about it, remember, this was the quiet one nourish the sh here's the key if you have a amino acid chain like this and right here and right here are two amino acids, where they have that sulfur.\nAndrew Ippolito: That can engage in a coal ballon bond, as you can see here is this little cartoony and so kind of acts like a staple or a.\nAndrew Ippolito: A joint that holds the protein structure intact and makes it stronger.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's the function of US it's called sometimes assault bridge and sometimes called the dice sulfide bond and there's whole variations here, some of them are Ionic some other Mirko ballin but but suffers almost always engaged there and that's all you have to know.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it increases the strength of the 3D structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so they're here here's a little bit more of a detail there's the dice all five branch, you can see that there would be so like the Alpha carbon be right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and this would be the side chain and the Alpha carbon be here on the other side, and this will be a side chain, and so you can see here, that would be this function on group, and that would be this function grip and they're engaging in that coviello box.\nAlexa Deprisco: Okay, is this what would help that form then it's back in their instructions.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah sure you can it can like maybe this will help support you know i'll be depleted sheet or something but, more importantly, this is the kind of stuff we find in hardy proteins that don't easily break.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, for example, you guys have probably all heard that there are you know bacteria that live in the salt lake and you know salt lake utah or in the thermal in the hot springs I there's life in those places these very inhospitable places they're called extreme of files.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so they have enzymes that can survive in these crazy environments, and this is one of the reasons why they can survive in their environments is there proteins are have these kinds of modifications within them help them with Stan the crazy environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay alright so here's here's right here's the summary of it all here's your approach, so this is a good slide for that if you want to come back to this one, there is your primary sequence right primary string of amino acids it folds up into secondary structures there's your secondary.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay overall one single poly peptide gives us tertiary three tertiary alright, and so this is an example here of the neat how you pronounce this transparency.\nAndrew Ippolito: Transparent 10 is a protein we find in our neurons okay so that's the transparent and poly peptide because watch this we're going to take transparent to we're going to take four of them so transparent in the protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: cautionary protein has four. Andrew Ippolito: Sub units that are all the same, and so this is a homework.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so you can see here this overall fancy three dimensional shape that will be it's quadrant a structure, this would be it's tertiary it would have various secondary structures.\nWhich when you. Andrew Ippolito: spread it all apart called DNA creation, you can see.\nAndrew Ippolito: The primary structure and that's that okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: primary, secondary tertiary quarter.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, let's talk about proteins themselves now so so we got this thing all right, just like any other molecule it's doing this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so it was vibrating everything's always vibrating right and and so, because this has a structure to it relatively delicate structure, if we keep this up too much too fast eventually falls apart that's called D nature.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so proteins can do nature if you cook eggs, this morning you crack an egg over on the skillet and it starts out as a liquid and it's a little goofy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because that's albumen which is soluble in water, and as you heat it up the album and starts to fall apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so here, if I have two albums and proteins watch so don't wait this down just look at me for a second.\nAndrew Ippolito: I got to album and proteins this called globular proteins are seibel and water Okay, as opposed to a filament is protein which would have a.\nAndrew Ippolito: structure that's like this Okay, so this would be a filament is protein like your hair like character right not soluble in water.\nAndrew Ippolito: soluble in water Okay, so you have globular and filament is chickens to globular protein, like to add.\nAndrew Ippolito: To our demons floating around the water okay these get hotter and hotter and hotter all right now let's think about this for a second let's consider this protein here, the reason why it's soluble in water right let's go back to our water chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: The amino acids on the surface here what kind of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right what likes water there's water out here they're going to like each other, so this is polar or charged right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas watch this now, if I was to go inside the protein and look in here at these amino acids, these would be hydrophobic amino acids, these would be amino acids that have side chains that are just hydrocarbons like vaguely.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the overall shape of the structure is driven by the primary sequence right, and so, if this is a water soluble approach like.\nAndrew Ippolito: The happy long as it's in the shape, as it gets hot what happens it gets so hot it's secondary structure start to fall apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: kind of like how water melts right but, instead, what we're doing here is we're breaking all these hydrogen bonds and we're getting this kind of it doesn't look exactly like this it just falls apart.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when they all fall apart in the same way, the fossil if it's you know, in the middle of the fossil it's been by layer all the hydrophobic tales are doing this to each other right because he.\nAndrew Ippolito: Was. Andrew Ippolito: Rushing them together in the same way.\nAngela Harbeck: proteins, as the D. Andrew Ippolito: Nature their hydrophobic areas will tend to aggregate and you get these big clumps of just messy protein that are solids they're called aggregates.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what that word down there says aggregation okay so teenager ation leads to protein aggregates.\nAndrew Ippolito: an egg white when you fry your egg that's solid that is D natured protein that has been aggregated.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and in general that kind of DNA Theresa when you heat it up like that you can't go backwards, so you would talk about that being irreversible teenagers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, other times so by took this let's say this is albumin again.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I put this. Andrew Ippolito: into an environment where its pH is different than it's used to that might also teenagers right so changing the pH will do nature, but if I change the pH back that might read nature so there's a reversible and irreversible D major Asian.\nwater. Alexa Deprisco: Now aggregation is irreversible, Dimitri yeah and.\nAndrew Ippolito: I have trouble saying that now because. Andrew Ippolito: It turns out a couple years back, scientists figured out how to reverse egg integration through a chemical process like why.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know honestly I can imagine. Andrew Ippolito: That. Alexa Deprisco: That news conference where. Andrew Ippolito: somebody like, why did you do this and they're like.\nWe want to. Alexa Deprisco: cook an egg huh.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah. Andrew Ippolito: Exactly you know and i'm sure that there was like enough camera there was whatever like chemistry was they use probably made it not fit for consumption, after that, but.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you think they could recreate the idea of taking a traditionally irreversible process and reversing it, they did it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's why it's hard for I can't really say anymore that's irreversible like you're you're talking like in the old days, we could say that, but everything you know there's exceptions to everything and things more complicated than you think."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Proteins","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the structure and function of proteins, including the importance of proper folding and the role of chaperones.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so how did I get the product, what did I have to do, I had to take this CAP and I had to take this marker and I had to align them.\nAndrew Ippolito: perfectly right, I mean I can't just let's put the CAD cam put the cap on the market right, you have to align them perfectly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then it's not just enough to align them, you have to push them together and not just a little bit right I can't just lightly push this together, I have to put some force into this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right now, I have my product So what did I have to do, I had to line them up in space and I had to push them together.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so two things we're gonna this has been a thread we've talked about a couple times now so i'm going to give it to you again remember entropy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Chaos right so degrees of freedom, think of the degrees of freedom these things have with these are floating around in a solution right.\nAndrew Ippolito: They can move in any direction wherever they want the chances that they're going to line up just perfectly.\nAndrew Ippolito: At the same time that they're moving next to each other, the chances of that are very low right okay so there's two things, though there's there's their alignment.\nAndrew Ippolito: The order their degrees of freedom so there's a measure there somewhere about entropy and there's how faster moving their temperature.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so what an enzyme does is look at my hands my hands are enzyme right i'm going to line them up and push them together, so what enzymes do is they take away.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the solution the randomness there, the amount of energy would take for them to line up perfectly and hit each other at just the right speed.\nAndrew Ippolito: The enzyme does that work for it. Andrew Ippolito: So, if you look at the slide now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if the starting components start here, so this is energy Okay, they start here on the energy continuum and they fall down to the products.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see how they have to go up the hill first this raise in that energy is that's the energy it takes to get the reaction and go, this is why the sugar in your cupboard isn't just spontaneously blowing up right, you need to put energy into a system for it to go forward.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what the enzyme does is it reduces that amount of energy by lining things up just.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, basically, it sets it up for a win. Andrew Ippolito: All right, and we'll talk more about this one we do enzymes later, so if that just kind of made a little sense to you great.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's all I wanted to do just I want you to start thinking about this now, so that by the units incubating in your head a little bit so when we get to it later it won't be shocking and new.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so for this test right now for the pullback now for this lecture for this test for the series of assessments.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's enough to understand that enzymes are protein catalysts, and the reason why they are catalysts is because they lower the energy of activation Okay, and you would rate E sub a that's the energy of activation.\nAndrew Ippolito: And by activation we mean that's the threshold, upon which the reaction will then go to completion rapidly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here's the last analogy i'll use for that you have a soccer ball you're up on a hill you put the soccer ball down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can imagine there's a soccer ball on a hill right here or a cliff right and then there's there's the floor block and you're up here that soccer ball so there's no wind, the soccer balls stable right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Until you do what to it, you kick it a little bit just a little bit let's say you give it just a little nudge.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that little nudge that you give it that's the activation energy is now just going to fall down hill right it's going to go all the way down rapidly and do whatever it's going to do, and give up energy until it comes to rest Okay, so that little kick is your energy of activation.\nAndrew Ippolito: raise your hand that made a little sense. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, good that's all I need you to be right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: So enzymes let's give you some vocabulary. Andrew Ippolito: Now. Angela Harbeck: You have the substrate. Andrew Ippolito: The substrate is just the thing and acts upon right, so in this example here on the right, we have an enzyme called.\nAndrew Ippolito: That could be laughed tastes like Oh, this is to crease and this example, so your sucrose glucose and galactose so you would see sucrose is the substrate sucrose bind to the enzyme in a little groove here that fits perfectly and we call that the active site.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the substrate bucks the act of sex. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, you would write that mathematically like this enzyme plus substrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm going to make this a bi directional arrow because all chemical reactions are theoretically reversible we get this thing called the enzyme substrate.\nComplex. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so this would be substrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: This would be enzyme this would be the enzyme substrate complex.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, what that does is a catalyze is the event to where you get an enzyme with a product in it so yeah the enzyme product complex.\nAndrew Ippolito: And all this is bi directional and then the product.\nAndrew Ippolito: associates you get enzyme plus product.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here i'll write that out all linearly enzyme substrate. Andrew Ippolito: The enzyme substrate complex.\nAndrew Ippolito: leads to the enzyme product complex. Andrew Ippolito: leads to the enzyme plus product.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so, this is an example, right here on the slide of a hydraulic enzyme hydrolysis remember that there's there's water molecule or somewhere."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Nucleic Acids and Nucleotides","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces nucleic acids as polymers and nucleotides as their building blocks.

Andrew Ippolito: And so, this is an example, right here on the slide of a hydraulic enzyme hydrolysis remember that there's there's water molecule or somewhere.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Any questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so here are some specific names of some specific proteins Just to give you some context insulins approaching I didn't know that.\nAndrew Ippolito: insulin you've heard me everybody's heard of insulin before it's a protein it's a protein hormones glucagon is a counterpart to insulin and the yin Yang of that system hemoglobin.\nAndrew Ippolito: high density lipoproteins low density lipoprotein These are the things in your we talked about your cholesterol levels.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those are the two assessments you put in your your blood tests growth hormone sometimes you'll see G F as a growth factor actin and myosin, these are the two proteins involved in your muscle movement and literally all.\nAlexa Deprisco: I did was we should. Alexa Deprisco: All right. Andrew Ippolito: This is the last part of this chapter that we're going to start. Andrew Ippolito: cells today and Wednesday we're going to finish cells and the Friday get your test on at all So here we go nucleic acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first thing I want to hit home here impress upon you, is the phrase nucleic acid is a polymer like poly saccharine or poly peptide nucleic acid you put those in your head in the same cluster of meaning in your head Okay, these are polymers.\nAndrew Ippolito: What are the polymers of the monitors are called nucleotides.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's talk about a nucleotide now in the same way we so I want you to put this in your head, alongside the amino acids okay as a refresher the amino acid has the Alpha carbon the carb oxalic group the amino group in the site.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's a nucleotide. Andrew Ippolito: there's a phosphate group phosphoric acid there's a five carbon sugar of pintos sugar.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's either ribosome the oxy rainbows. Andrew Ippolito: And then, what we call them nitrogen is base, or you call it just the base some books will call it a nuclear obese.\nAndrew Ippolito: New Clio be I hate this phrase because i've never heard it before it's just a lack of familiarity, is why I hate it I don't say hates a strong word I I call it a nitrogen is bs.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's more meaningful, though, but just make sure if you see the phrase nuclear base out in the wild it's just synonymous with nitrogen the space.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the nitrogen this piece. Alexa Deprisco: is coming to families have have have. Andrew Ippolito: Two families of organic molecules there's the permissions and the periods.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, yes, you do need to i'll show you how this all gets here but you're going to need to know all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's that's the building blocks now let's see some some structures here.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first thing I want to tell you is the word period the periods are the big ones in terms of their structures, when we say big you're going to see that there's one ring or two rings Okay, so the puritans that weren't periods very guttural purity.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the big that's the moment the two weeks. Andrew Ippolito: And then you have you can mumble have on your breath perimeter seems not to be a high.\nperimeter. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you can burn Maybe you can say that periods are silver right, you know the atomic element silver is pretty big.\nAnd I had no good memory thing for TC. Sorry.\nSo just remember ag silver and then everything else you can derive.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So let's talk about the nucleotide.\nAndrew Ippolito: By themselves called nucleotides you can mean two things right, so a single new just like mono saccharine have a function right like glucose has a function, the short term energy use.\nAndrew Ippolito: Mano nucleotides like ATP right have that they are immediate energy for the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's also timers of nucleotides right, so we have things, called die nucleotides these are very important molecules and if you write this word down now die nucleotide and you think of them as a pair of nucleotides is a dime American thing this will help you understand stuff later.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay you've probably seen these before in your earlier classes and ED ED to remember you're starting to like oh that's like Krebs cycle stone for metabolism stuff oh I hate man.\nAndrew Ippolito: nad and fat and so that these words here are simply descriptors of dynamically types of deals die nuclear decay so n is Nikitina mind.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to memorize any of this just yet, but Nick attend to mind is just another nitrogen space adenosine the a's adenosine that's the a an ATP that's that's the the am the alphabet have a you know, a PSE amp G OK, and then fs flavin.\nAndrew Ippolito: But will learn about all this later, for now, I just want to impress upon you this word diet nucleotide Okay, and then you have poly nucleotides and we don't usually use that phrase, but a poly nucleotide as a nucleic acid.\nOkay, and there's only two of them there's DNA and RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, alright. Andrew Ippolito: We hold them together here's the special named bond for the nucleic acids, the phosphor diaster bond.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so the phosphor diaster bond sounds a lot, like the one that holds liquids together the ester bond right, so we have if there's an ester in there, but it's fast formulated so there's the phosphor.\nAndrew Ippolito: learn how this adele later.\nAndrew Ippolito: The double stranded helix of DNA is held together by hydrogen bonds as we'll see i'll show you that later that's really, this is an inappropriate place to put this right now so don't worry too much about the hydro bods in this slide.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so you can burn this into your head the a pairs with the tea and the G pairs with the CN DNA and the way I remember that is a empty or both letters that have straight lines.\nAndrew Ippolito: and G and C have curves So if you have to memorize a mountain but, honestly, though this time you play with this enough you'll see just you'll put a empty in your head and gnc.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a pairing with T forms two hydrogen bonds and G pairing with see forms three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so way I used to write this to remember it. was a in a tea would look like my initials my initials are Ai so there's two laws of top and the bottom and then G and C.\nAndrew Ippolito: The G thing has an extra one there's one in the middle there more carefully so there's those two and then there's that middle one.\nI still can't put them on the same plane there we go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so gnc form three hydrogen bonds when they pair and anti only form to, and that has a lot of important implications leader or in terms of unwinding the double helix to do things.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, so why is that a pairing with the T and G pairing with the see well, it turns out, you take a big one, and pair it with a low one and you end up getting a uniform helix that has that's the same size.\nUniform diameter there. Andrew Ippolito: Which is about a.\nTwo nanometers. In terms of the size that's two nanometers.\nteeny tiny. Andrew Ippolito: And there, they are you don't have to memorize these structures but here's the take home, you can see that adenine.\nhas two rings. Andrew Ippolito: cytosine has one ring because he Simon has one ring and guanine has two rings right, so the idea there big those are the right a n G remember the periods.\nAnd they're big. Andrew Ippolito: And then see in T or the perimeter.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there are small. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Now, and RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is no fine me. Andrew Ippolito: Instead there's another beast called yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look closely, though you'll notice that you're selling fine mean are the same molecule the only difference being we methylation yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you could think of five mean as methylation yourself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so just swap out the tea and put a you in there when you're dealing with RNA sequences rate, so if the DNA sequence is a T g.\nC. Andrew Ippolito: Okay let's say that this is one strand of DNA the compliment to that let's think about that, if this was the RNA compliment.\nAndrew Ippolito: That a would pair with the key normally but because of RNA we would see you right but here's the mistake students make that T does not pair with you the two pairs with a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the G pairs with this si si pairs with the G, so the compliment to a is you a compliment of tea is a compliment or talking about compliment the base pairs.\nOkay, this is DNA, and this is RNA that's the idea there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that is replaced with the you and then T is i'm sorry the a would complement a you and the team of correspond to the."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Base Pairing and Nucleotide Triphosphates","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the base pairing rules in DNA and RNA, including the complementary base pairs.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay T does not pair with you that's the mistake, I see sometimes students will mistake that that's the key there okay so just swap you empty in your head don't they don't they they're never in the same place they're like Clark Kent Superman they're never the same place the same.\nThe same thing. Andrew Ippolito: All right now we can start you know what here i'm going to go to the whiteboard now.\nAndrew Ippolito: where's whiteboard. might have accidentally closed it.\nwhiteboard Where are you. yeah I don't know why closed, I want to share my screen here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a PR so you have to pay attention this we're going to draw so feel free to get your colors out if you want.\nsure that. i'm at my correct amount here.\noops. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, here we go so nucleotide.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's how you draw nucleotide I always start with drawing something that looks kind of like the big dipper.\nlike that. Andrew Ippolito: And then have a ball drop in it and there's there's the carbon backbone to rainbows.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: We name is blue here we name these carbons like this that's the one prime carbon right here, the two prime carbon right here, the three prime carbon.\nFor prime. Andrew Ippolito: Five right, so this this is.\nThe pen to sugar. Andrew Ippolito: i'm not saying I boast or dlc rivals just yet, because that's just the carbon back.\nAndrew Ippolito: attached to the one problem is wherever whatever base is attached to the nucleotide that's the piece.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and this combination.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of the base and the sugar here is called a nuclear side.\nAndrew Ippolito: attached to the five prime carbon. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to put the phosphate group.\nTo three minus I can remember it's I think it's peel for my appeal for.\nYou know let's just keep this symbol let's just make it a pure the circle around it that's usually how I do it.\nphosphate group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and when all three of them are together that's the nucleotide.\nAndrew Ippolito: nucleus sides don't have phosphate nucleotides.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now. Andrew Ippolito: If the two prime carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has the hydroxyl group on it, along with the three prime carbon there's a pair of hydroxyl groups there.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the default state of rainbows.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I see are an RNA. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, if the two prime carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has. Andrew Ippolito: You can't really see purple against black, let me find a better color here use orange.\nWe get fitter. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, if it's just a hydrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, in other words, I removed the oxygen from the to prime carbon, I want to call this to dash.\nAndrew Ippolito: d oxy by bus okay So these are two different sugars there's the Rainbow sugar or there's a dlc rainbow sugar.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we have two kinds of nucleotides. Andrew Ippolito: OK, we have rainbow I mean use the color coding here is i've created here ribosome will give rise to rainbow nucleotides.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the oxy rivals will give rise to D oxy rainbow nucleotides.\nStill with me. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is the right, this is the building block for nucleic acids either rival nucleic acids, or the oxy ribonucleic gases.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're building things we're building polymers of things we're doing anabolic reactions were needing energy right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the question now is where has the energy come from to build these things, and the answer to that is from the nucleotide itself what we're gonna do is we're going to take that phosphate and we're going to add two more to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: In other words, we're going to give this thing a bunch of energy. Andrew Ippolito: This thing here with the three phosphates that's called.\nAndrew Ippolito: A nucleotide or a diner or a Dr Robin nucleotide new Clio tied.\nAndrew Ippolito: triphosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we can abbreviate that as a nucleotide try phosphate NTP.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is a generic word NTP. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, if the sugar is just plain old ribosome we call them NTP.\nAndrew Ippolito: If the sugars, the oxy right but we put a lowercase D in front of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's no GPS and there's DNS GPS. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so, in other words.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's nucleotide triphosphate or dioxide nucleotide triphosphate and again in two molecules there's there's the molecules if the sugar is rainbows it's an NTP if the sugars, the oxy rainbows it's a lowercase T in front of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so. Andrew Ippolito: This is also, I am very fully aware, this is a lot to digest okay so bear with me i'll give it out you're going to keep talking here ready let's cartoon this just as a cartoony version of this i'm just going to doodle.\nThis again. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, I just doodled a nucleotide triphosphate.\nOkay. NTP i'll use white.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's an NTP it's a nucleotide because it has a fast feed a sugar and obese has got three he's got three phosphates through we're going to see that's a try nucleotide i'm sorry i'm sorry I misspoke it's a triphosphate at a nucleotide triphosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now if I ripped one of those phosphates off. So here, let me, let me do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: watch this if I take that same molecule right I just copied that molecule i'm going to rip one of the phosphates off.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can now call this a nucleotide triphosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you're never going to see NDP so let's let's hear let's give a specific example of an NTP let's say that this base let's say that we set this base equal to a OK, so the name of that is adenine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, which we saw earlier adenine is one of the four bases in DNA and RNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we're going to call this here. adenosine.\nAndrew Ippolito: triphosphate. Andrew Ippolito: You see what I did there adenine is the name of the base.\nAndrew Ippolito: When adenine is a component of a nucleotide the name of that nucleotide is adenosine.\nAndrew Ippolito: big word big molecule small word small molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: adenosine is the name of the nucleotide or the nucleus side, whatever and adding is so so this right here, I just drew a mark of ATP you've already you've heard of ATP before that's what it is okay, as long as the sugars rainbows right, this is this is rainbows here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So ATP is an RNA nucleotide. Andrew Ippolito: When I take ATP and I rip a phosphate off of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let me get rid of this and here and just make it a that's a dp okay so ATP ATP are the same molecule just you just ripping off petals of the flower, so to speak, ripping off the phosphate if I rip off another one.\nAndrew Ippolito: So if I if I take this molecule here i'm going to get off over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: There we go, I want to rip off another phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not gonna call this adenosine Mano phosphate see that, so we have ATP falls down to a dp which falls down to a MP.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we can get the lingo in your head. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right. So.\nAndrew Ippolito: I just realized i'm writing on a whiteboard I use last week don't ignore all the bottom right here not to worry about any of this.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, let's give me some names I said adenine here.\nI don't know why the color change in the middle of it that was really weird try that again and I see, I have a chat message along.\nOkay i'm gonna get the message. Andrew Ippolito: The names are yeah not the am PDP to we're going to talk about this all next all throughout the Semester so i'm not going to ask you, specific questions about this.\nAndrew Ippolito: right but you'll you'll and you'll see i'm not going to say what's adenine what's the timing, but you're going to see these words everywhere so let's do this adenine fine mean.\nAndrew Ippolito: cytosine. Guan. years.\nOkay, those are the names, these are the basis.\nOkay they're either appearing.\nHere let's do this. they're either appearing.\nor primitive. Andrew Ippolito: let's make this a circle and as an x so adenine and guanine remember AG, those are the periods.\nAnd then finding cytosine and yourself or the perimeter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay adenine gives rise to the nuclear side.\nadenosine. Andrew Ippolito: Timing gives rise to the nuclear side.\nAndrew Ippolito: Fine Medina. Andrew Ippolito: cytosine gives rise to sit a Dean.\nAndrew Ippolito: guanine gives rise to guana scene. Andrew Ippolito: And you're still gives rise to your read Dean you'll notice that the scene and the Dean, have to do with the period and the perimeter.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the periods, give rise to science and the PR mediums give rise to dion's so there's no such thing as time missing there's time eating.\nThose this thing is identity identity, I guess there's adenosine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can put the name Now you can take this that there's a tip or there's DTP right So these are the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Rather, that these would be the RNA nucleotides and these would be the DNA nucleotides.\nRight, you have ttp. Andrew Ippolito: I should say you have D ttp there is no RNA with a tna.\nYou guys see tp and DC tp. You got ddp and ddp.\nAnd then you have you tip. You don't get do you to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: And these right here are the building blocks of DNA and RNA.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Again, you don't have to memorize all this right now just yet, but this is, as you get deeper and deeper into biology these where you're going to see these words everywhere and they'll confuse you if you don't know what they are."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Introduction","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the topic of DNA structure and function.","start":"1:04:58","end":"1:05:05","content":"Andrew Ippolito: You know I taught them the basics of this, the other day to that's kind of funny.\nOh boy. people's the rabbit hole go there, we go here's you guys."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Building an Employee","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of building an employee and emphasizes the importance of the five prime and three prime carbons.","start":"1:05:11","end":"1:06:20","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's build an employee uh let's say you guys are I see you guys are copying furiously here don't again don't worry about getting all the sounds in the slides do all this isn't the slides.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, what I want to do, the most important thing right now is to build, so this is, this is the most important part of this whole spiel what i'm about to do i'm going to zoom in here.\nalright.

Andrew Ippolito: So just like a poly peptide."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Nucleic Acid Polymerization","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of nucleic acid polymerization and the importance of building from the five prime to the three prime end.","start":"1:08:49","end":"1:11:29","content":"Okay.

Andrew Ippolito: And instead of it, the end and the C terminus we can call this the five prime end and we can call this the three primary.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: So what I just doodled here, this is a nucleic acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now nucleic acid is a polymer. Of nucleotides.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I know I just hit you with a whole lot. Alexis Micewski: Really fast and you guys look a little overwhelmed right now so.\nAlexis Micewski: Where the phosphate bond it to the which the hydrogen removed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember that we. Andrew Ippolito: pull water out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so I just stole it I don't know if that's totally you know i'm cartooning it so maybe, let me look back at the PowerPoint.\nlet's go.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is the if you want to actually you know, be more accurate with a chemistry there you go that's that's the actual bond, you have the five prime carbon would be actually this isn't even actually write the five prime carbons missing here, so this is dunkle I this.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's see if we could find an accurate version of this somewhere. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah okay here, this is this there's there's as accurate as going to get here yeah Okay, I did remove the age, that is correct, so here's the five prime carbon right here my hand the hand thing is over that's the five prime carbon right oops so here five prime carbon.\nAnd then the oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: phosphenes phosphate oxygen two three prime carbon and that right there that if we look at this slide now let's focus on the slide for a second you'll see so here's the five prime and here's the three prime end.\nAndrew Ippolito: right but importantly here, so I want you to look at this and see it, I want you to see the see the dlc rainbows.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, see the five prime and the three prime carbon right so there's the five there's the three, there is a five there's a three there's the five there's a three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're going this way from five to three so if we wanted to add more to this a nucleic acid we'd have to add it right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's your three prime and right we can't add here, we can only grow this chain in this direction okay so ready here's the sugar here's the philosophy, so we call this right here, we call this the sugar phosphate backbone."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"DNA Structure","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the structure of DNA, including the sugar-phosphate backbone and the base pairing rules.","start":"1:11:29","end":"1:15:12","content":"Andrew Ippolito: there's your three prime and right we can't add here, we can only grow this chain in this direction okay so ready here's the sugar here's the philosophy, so we call this right here, we call this the sugar phosphate backbone.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA. Andrew Ippolito: Okay now let's add the basis, you can see here in green there's adenine, and so this right here is adenosine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Linked underneath it to what is that looks like cytosine this is cytosine how do I know that because I see this name down here with a color coding so that would be sitting.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then a purple one is fine mean. And then the light are the light blue purple one is gone.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is. Alexa Deprisco: What I want to circle right now. Andrew Ippolito: This is one nucleic acid that has an A bound to a see bound to a TEE bound to a G that's what you're seeing here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Five prime three prime you see how I labeled it five five and three prime only name nucleic acids, when we when we write them out Okay, if this was a word document you would write this right five prime.\nAndrew Ippolito: A C T G three I didn't put a dash there but dash.\nAndrew Ippolito: Five prime dash. Andrew Ippolito: At AC tg yes.\nAngela Harbeck: I have a question yep good I thought you said that a empty or islands together, why is it good for ABC.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a great question okay. Angela Harbeck: So when we build nucleotides i'm sorry. Andrew Ippolito: When we've done nucleic acids daisy chain them together the basis can be in any order.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the link right there, this is how we build jeans right so that's that's the beginning of a genetic sequence.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you can put them in any order you want, you can just literally ramble a TT ag ag ACC tg that's that's the sequence of the.\nAndrew Ippolito: The key there, though, the rules we're going to get to now is let's look at the other side of this picture right I I haven't talked about this side at all that's another nucleic acid, these are two different chains.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we talked about proteins, we talked about this being a three dimensional folded up poly peptide in this being a different one we can interact, you can get a dimer DNA is a double strand molecule Okay, and so what we're going to do here, let me give you a simple version of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: here. Andrew Ippolito: Is a single nucleic acid there's five prime three prime.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and let's now draw the basis sticking out into space right so let's say a long one here like that would be an A.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, a shorter one here let's say that's a C and then i'm just making this up let's make that another a and let's make this a wider know a tea and let's make this a G let's put two g's together and then another a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I just made that up but it's always a big one or a little one right okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: On this side i'm going to draw another nucleic acid i'm going to turn it upside down notice this is now three prime, and this is five prime you see that it's upside down that's the first insight here for the double strand the dealers.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Double Stranded DNA","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of double stranded DNA and the anti-parallel nature of the DNA helix.","start":"1:15:12","end":"1:18:18","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, we call this anti parallel.\nAndrew Ippolito: You would say that the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here here's a little I printed this out last year, this is DNA right, you would say that this is an Anti parallel molecule and other words if I was to zoom in here, that would be if this was five prime this one here would be three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's always one end of the DNA molecule like one end of the double helix has a five and a three and this one has the three and five.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right, then so Angela This is where the base putting rules commands on this side.\nAndrew Ippolito: If this over here is a this over here is a tea.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if that sees over there. And this is a g.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, and I just realized I should have made the cheese longer here.\nAngela Harbeck: And the t's short so within an RNA that it would be the a's will be used them okay so so two things there first.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of all. RNA. Is single stranded.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we don't have double stranded RNA but. Andrew Ippolito: If this was a piece of RNA that i'm going to doodle here RNA can form secondary structures, like proteins.\nand other words watch this.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that so aren't you can do this, it can base pair with itself when we see these based pairing rules there if that's a that's a you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then in other instances we're going to see if this is our messenger RNA as we'll see later.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the messenger RNA is that another single stranded piece of RNA and those are the basis sticking up we're going to see the T RNA come in here and there's going to be based pairing here and that's another time we'll see days in the US.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: In DNA we don't have a you anywhere, and so this isn't a this would be a tea.\nSo the tea, this would be an A. si.\nsi. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and forgive me what I what I really wanted to do is hit on this idea that there's always a long and short.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that. Andrew Ippolito: Each when you add it together it's always the same total distance right if I put two shorts together.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if there were two shorts I understand that if there was a mistake here, what would happen is the DNA would actually pension together like this to get that closer and that'd, be a mistake, and if there were two big ones together, it would bulge up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's why the DNA helix his uniform in diameter because there's always a pure in match with a permanent."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 5 (Part 2) - Biological Macromolecules","link":"https://youtu.be/GOGNhYa6XX0?si=XWoDVNF3-xMG0p7R","chunkTitle":"Major and Minor Grooves","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the major and minor grooves of the DNA helix and their significance.","start":"1:18:18","end":"1:25:49","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's why the DNA helix his uniform in diameter because there's always a pure in match with a permanent.\nAlexa Deprisco: know if you were to have a DNA that was like Boeing or bowing out or like going in like How would that translate to like a creature, you know.\nAlexa Deprisco: That. Andrew Ippolito: that's Those are two examples of DNA lesions and those get repaired.\nAndrew Ippolito: The DNA ever looked like. This. Andrew Ippolito: right if it's like this and then there's this just crazy thing here that's called a bulky agent.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is stuff you're not gonna have to know here, but so there's there's enzymes, we have here, this is your DNA here, so we have these enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know that will ticker tape along DNA looking for stuff like this and then finds a little bump it will call it friends over and try to fix it.\nAndrew Ippolito: or but she's a little pinch right so there's a whole world of DNA surveillance and repair and your DNA is constant getting damaged, and so we have all sorts of stuff happening in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's where that's molecular biology level stuff let's say you'll learn more about that stuff in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your third year when you take molecular biology you want, maybe genetics, maybe you'll learn a little bit more detail that when you take your genetics class.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your transfer Institute in the meantime i'll give you a little bit of this, we have a whole chapter on DNA structure and function and we learned about mutations and repair and all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's like at the end of the Semester. Andrew Ippolito: The point of this part of this chapter in Chapter five is to introduce you to these natural molecules and give you a little bit of information and i've probably giving you a little bit more information than you need for this test.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but the reason for that is DNA, is the most important molecule on the planet and we're going to revisit this three or four times a semester, so you will have, by the end by the time we get to the final exam everything I said today you're going to need to know.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think of like a slow burn okay so i'm gonna go back to the slide now i'm going to show you the double stranded helix here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the double stranded helix of DNA this thing here you don't have to know all the specs and how deep everything is but you'll notice that it's an asymmetrical helix it's it when you draw DNA here's how you draw me ready you draw like this it dropped a little a symmetrical.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you select your first strand your second strain you start not in the middle here you don't want to start in the middle, I want to start a little bit up to one side, like here and then just try to parallel everything you just do it old like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what you're see is, if you can think of the 3D of this let's try to make this a ribbon now.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll notice that there is a big groove and a little groove we call it the the minor the minor groove.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the major. Minor groove major group.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here i'll draw draw a little simpler, so you can see it. Andrew Ippolito: i'll draw more exaggeratedly rather alright so minor groove.\nMajor group. Andrew Ippolito: here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually, this this 3D molecule is inaccurate and that is to symmetrical so this actually doesn't have a major minor in grief, this is even so this is wrong, I just realized that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here, I can do it better like this, because I can move these around watch this.\nTry this. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, I want to just copy this.\nAndrew Ippolito: and paste it, and now I can show you Okay, so if this was a perfectly symmetrical helix I would put it like.\nAndrew Ippolito: This Okay, but watch this this this will give you the insight, I want to take this piece i'm going to move it up to the top now it's a symmetrical.\nAndrew Ippolito: And DNA Z symmetrical. Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And you don't have to know the details anymore past that just understand it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a symmetrical got a major minor group. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the major groove would be right here like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: The minor groove would be the one right above it there. Taylor Campbell: And does that follow, along with the piercings and.\nAndrew Ippolito: Ah that's a great question know. Andrew Ippolito: The DNA. Andrew Ippolito: doesn't matter what order you put so if you think of the steps if you think of this like a spiral staircase Okay, the step is a base pair and that could be an either or the beach I should I should say either of the base pairs is like binary there's you're either at or your CG.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right or you're a ta or a gc whatever, but the idea here is this order is arbitrary, this could be any order.\nOkay, this this could be any order. Andrew Ippolito: This is always minor to major minor major the DNA helix is asymmetrical.\nAndrew Ippolito: For reasons that you'll learn in organic chemistry to or something.\nAlexa Deprisco: Okay, with the major the minor groups just depend on like what angle you're looking at the DNA strand.\nAndrew Ippolito: Ah, no, no, so. Andrew Ippolito: There are angles here, but if you if you were holding this up and looking at it you'd be like there's a major groove like.\nhere. Andrew Ippolito: Okay watch this like it do this here this this pretend, this is a protein that buys the DNA i'm in one of the groups right now see that.\nwatch this i'm in a group OK now i'm in the next group. Andrew Ippolito: CDs So these are the group so if I rotate it.\nAndrew Ippolito: That that groove is still. Andrew Ippolito: it's still the same size of that group so yeah it doesn't matter if you're doing this, if you're twisting it now again, this is a symmetrical helix, so this is not right, if this was a symmetrical Am I start rotating it.\nAndrew Ippolito: You would very easily see that the spacing here yeah here we go i'll closing it before it gets blurry ready this right here would be the minor groove.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then this would be the major group if this was a symmetrical imagine me taking this strand here and moving it up like I did in the word the whiteboard.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if I was able to compress this if I was able to make the distance here shorter Can you see that that would necessarily make the distance here bigger.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if I if I moved this up the distance between here, and here we get bigger and so you'd have a minor groove and a major group.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now look at the screen now, and you can see that imagine the the pipe cleaner that I just held up right here like this, so compare what I just doodled to what you're looking at on my video right and now look now do this and you'll see the major.\non the screen. Right here's a matrix roof.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Minor major minor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you know what if you can't see this that's okay this this is this is advanced, this is more advanced than we need to be.\nRight.

Andrew Ippolito: Right, the building block of life.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's two kinds of cells in the world to fundamentally different architectures we call them the prokaryotes and then you carry.\nAndrew Ippolito: The words themselves are derived from berries Greek roots.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carry on which means Colonel like kernel of corn.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's the word we use to describe what the nucleus looks like when we look under the microscope mostly a little kernel a corner.\nAndrew Ippolito: He you when you put you in front of a word like Europe. Andrew Ippolito: Europe, or you carry out you.\nAndrew Ippolito: means well defined are good, and so you would say that a eukaryotic cell is a cell that has a well defined nucleus.\nthat's why we call it a you carry. Andrew Ippolito: Pro that means come before right think of like the prologue of a story.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the prokaryotes are named from an evolutionary tip of the hat they came before the carrier's.\nAndrew Ippolito: There is a classification system, we learned about on day one called the moose classification system, the three domains system and so within this little.\nAndrew Ippolito: cloud of ground Landrover here. Andrew Ippolito: You got your bacteria your cans and your eukaryotes Those are the three domains of life, we learned about previously.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: These are not formal taxonomic terms, at least not yet these are body architectures right the bacteria in New York hands are very, very different from each other from.\nAndrew Ippolito: In terms of evolution they're just as different from each other, as they are from the carrier right, but under a microscope these guys look almost identical that doesn't mean they are.\nAndrew Ippolito: The key difference to all of this was the evolution of multicellular rarity.\nAndrew Ippolito: The character multicellular. Andrew Ippolito: is really what distinguishes everything visually for us right the plants, the animals and the fungus or all multicellular.\nAndrew Ippolito: The eukaryotes that are not multicellular we can lump them roughly together is what we call the protests.\nAndrew Ippolito: Protests themselves can be roughly lumped as the algae.\nAnd the protozoa. Andrew Ippolito: approaches ellen's would be the animal like and the fungus like.\nSo their head or a truths. Andrew Ippolito: And the algae would be. The Auto trips like like the plans the plant like protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason why protest isn't really formally a kingdom anymore, is because there is no single common ancestor to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're very like there's no common ancestor to all the algae's there's different common ancestors, whereas there's a single common ancestor to the animals, a single common ancestor to that fungus in the planets right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's. Andrew Ippolito: The idea of the cell is born from this empirical work that happened, you know spanning two centuries Robert hook first looked under the microscope back in the late 1600s.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he noted a piece of Cork that he looked at was organized and these little beautiful arrays that reminded him of the."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 6 (Part 1) - The Cell","link":"https://youtu.be/JImbdyaCGs8?si=L1ukfDEvpGpHy8me","chunkTitle":"History of Cell Discovery","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the historical context of cell discovery and the concept of cells as the building blocks of life.","start":"9:37","end":"12:05","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And he noted a piece of Cork that he looked at was organized and these little beautiful arrays that reminded him of the.\nAndrew Ippolito: The rooms that monks living in a monastery which were called cells and so he called these little tiny.\nAndrew Ippolito: square like things cells and that's where the working from you can actually click on this and go read his original work published in 1665 called micro graph via.\nAndrew Ippolito: The original at Google Google, did you know they have this whole book project where they're scanning and all the all the good stuff and you can go and look at that firsthand.\nAndrew Ippolito: Within the same timeframe, there was another guy named Antonio you and hook who looked he made his own microscopes and he saw he saw bacteria and proteins for the first time, and so he was the one that instigated the renaissance of learning about all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: But so it wasn't for another 200 years before we were able to finally confidently say that looking under the microscope and looking at plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because plants are more well defined under the microscope and that's when a slide in this guy slide in here said that all plants are made out of cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know don't worry about the deeds don't worry about the deeds tori just ball, you know just this is just the historical context.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no, Robert hook Robert hook, is a very famous biology he's not a biologist he's a polymath you guys know that word is polymath.\nAndrew Ippolito: Even order polymath is a pie math is somebody who is a has provided contributions to multiple branches of science.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you can't call him just the biologist because he was also a chemist but he's also physicist but there's also an engineer that's a polymath you know, Leonardo da Vinci polymath Robert hook polymath.\nAndrew Ippolito: So slide in said all planets are made of cells and then very quickly like within the same year, so shawan said all animals are made out of cells, and so what came out of all their work was this concept called self here all life is made of cells, the smallest unit of life is the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: So and that's that's that's it for the the history stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the question now is is why our cells so damn small that's we're going to talk about."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 6 (Part 1) - The Cell","link":"https://youtu.be/JImbdyaCGs8?si=L1ukfDEvpGpHy8me","chunkTitle":"Why Cells are Small","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of surface area to volume ratio and its importance in cell size.","start":"12:05","end":"17:04","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So the question now is is why our cells so damn small that's we're going to talk about.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we have to think about a little bit physics here. Andrew Ippolito: Right, I want you to picture a glass of water.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to drop. Andrew Ippolito: Some food coloring in there and just watch it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it'd be cool if first and get boring right it sila swirly patterns and then it was slowly, it is getting blurry and then it would just kind of be like watching grass grow at that point Okay, but here's the thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: A cell. Andrew Ippolito: needs to be able.\nAndrew Ippolito: To exchange things with its environment. Andrew Ippolito: And it needs to do so fast.\nAndrew Ippolito: It needs to get rid of wastes before they kill it. Andrew Ippolito: needs to bring in food.\nAndrew Ippolito: Before it dies. Andrew Ippolito: It needs to react to its environment needs to make sure it can run away from predators.\nAndrew Ippolito: or respond to chemical signals in the environment right, so there needs to be a speed at which the cell can respond to its environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is constrained by some basic laws of physics that we'll talk about in the next chapter.\nAndrew Ippolito: For now, just understand if you look at this little glass, I draw on the right here that little red arrow the idea here is, I want you to consider the amount of time it takes for some substance to reach the border, because the border is everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the boundary point. Andrew Ippolito: between life and not life, we have to cross this threshold they let things out and we have to cross that threshold to bring things in so the surface is everything to excel.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I want you to consider to shapes I want you to consider a cube.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say it's one centimeter about one centimeter. Andrew Ippolito: And I want you to think about this cube and I want you to think about what's whatever is inside the cube and if it needs to get out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anything that's inside of it, it has to reach a surface so something deep in the harder that cube has to take its time to get to the edge.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Now, take that same volume of space okay so again I want you to think about this volume of space here to forget the cube.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think about this cube is living in a little piece of real estate in space there's that space there and let's replace that one cube with a series of much more cube many more cubes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you to think about the surface area of any individual cube within this complex and the fact that each one of those cubes has its own surface area, such that if I consider this whole system here think of how much more surface area, I have to interact with the environment.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: So in any given point in that volume of space, I am not too far away from a surface to exchange with the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that right, there is the reason cells are so small. Andrew Ippolito: that's why we are made, not out of one big sack but.\nAndrew Ippolito: trillions of little sex there's like 30 trillion cells in your body.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's an insane number, and this is why Okay, so you can you can distill that concept into one basic thought process, they have to be big enough to hold what they need, but small enough to rapidly exchange with their environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why that speed is so important is because of survival.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and competition. Andrew Ippolito: If you're moving slower than me i'm going to beat you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have you guys ever heard that lawyer joke to lawyers are walking in the woods.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a bear comes out and one of the lawyers immediately drops the ground opens his briefcase and starts putting on his running shoes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the lawyer standing above him confused as, why are you putting on your running shoes, you cannot run a bear and a lawyer gets up with his running shoes and says, I don't have to outrun the bear I just have to outrun you.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then he runs. Andrew Ippolito: This and there's life in a nutshell.\nAndrew Ippolito: replace running fast with whatever is going to make you survive better with the other people around you or the other cells competing right, so the reason why cells are that size.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is because if they were any bigger they'd be too slow and any smaller they wouldn't be able to hold enough stuff is the sweet spot.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we can translate all this into this concept, called the surface area to volume ratio Okay, there is a specific ratio, if you think of this cube over here, and you didn't math to calculate the surface area, you can abbreviate SA."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 6 (Part 1) - The Cell","link":"https://youtu.be/JImbdyaCGs8?si=L1ukfDEvpGpHy8me","chunkTitle":"Prokaryotes","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito provides an overview of prokaryotic cells, including their cell extensions, extracellular coverings, and internal components.","start":"17:04","end":"29:33","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we can translate all this into this concept, called the surface area to volume ratio Okay, there is a specific ratio, if you think of this cube over here, and you didn't math to calculate the surface area, you can abbreviate SA.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, and think about a surface area is a two dimensional quantity right there's length and there's tight or width or whatever there's two dimensions there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you multiply those together right if this was all the same, you would have X squared. Andrew Ippolito: We talking about so this would be because it's the cube right, it will be six X squared whatever don't worry about the math but now it's calculate the volume, the volume requires 3D.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right X, Y and Z so that function. Andrew Ippolito: Is a cube.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words, imagine a water take a balloon and blow it up just think of a single, simple balloon from a party.\nAndrew Ippolito: And as you blow it up, I want you to think about the rate at which the surface area.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of that balloon would increase over time so think about surface area increasing over time, it would be exponential right, that would be an x squared graph from your math class, but the surf but the volume rather the volume would be.\nAndrew Ippolito: much faster because that's going to be with the cube.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: I think of an elephant and a mouse.\nAndrew Ippolito: an elephant has way more volume compared to its surface area than a mouse does this is why an elephant's heartbeat so slow and a mouse is beat so fast.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's because there's other reasons for that that's a bad analogy, but just think of their size differences.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so think about a bacterial cell and eukaryotic cell they have different surface areas and volumes and the ratio between the two of them is going to change over time, the bigger you get.\nAndrew Ippolito: The the bigger fraction the volume is going to take up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so here, if you look at this. Andrew Ippolito: Look at these numbers let's just put some numbers here okay so let's think of a single sub four centimeter cube here I don't know why they use four centimeters you could use one to make the math easier, but whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, total surface area 96 cubic centimeters right here now let's take that and make it eight two centimeter cubes let's just chop it and top.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we now have a surface area of 192 centimeters right why because we're adding this we're adding this new information here this new surfaces okay cut it into 64 one centimeter cubes and you now have 384 cubic Center square centimeters.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the volume didn't change only the surface area did, in other words, we are occupying the same space.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so see how their volumes, the same 64 cubic centimeters and so when you take their surface area and divide it by their volume you get some number right so 1.5 to one or 321 or six to one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, this is what we're going for maximizing the surface area to volume ratio, we want this surface area to volume ratio to be as big as possible.\nAndrew Ippolito: Hopefully that made some sense. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so the surface area to volume ratio is the key factor here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we can look now at prokaryotes versus eukaryotes so we can see how much bigger they are.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can ballpark this and say that approach periodic cells between 10 to 100 times smaller than a eukaryotic cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Within new carrier some pro carriers, you have a very significant size range, you have like a tenfold ranger.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the smallest sell in the human body versus the biggest selling human bodies 10 times bigger so you there's no easy way to compare these so you say between 10 and 100 Okay, the reason.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why by carrier so small, you can now understand they don't have internal surfaces.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're just a SEC of stuff because they don't like a little water balloon filled with stuff and so, if it's too big it's gonna.\nAndrew Ippolito: react too slow and die. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the reason why the eukaryotic cell can get bigger is because if you randomly put your finger anywhere in there in any location you're never going to be that far away from a surface.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the system as a whole is really a whole bunch of subsystems.\nAndrew Ippolito: each with their own surfaces that's what the cost of the organelles comes into play.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: So you would see that. Andrew Ippolito: should go ahead.\nAlexa Deprisco: I was gonna say so each surface then you're referring to would be like the membrane enclosed. Andrew Ippolito: Oregon yeah yeah yeah.\nExactly. Andrew Ippolito: Because membranes are where exchange occurs.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I want you guys to think back to the video you just watched just for a moment the when we think of a membrane I don't want you to think of a membrane like a balloon anymore or a piece of cellophane.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to think of it like that waxy lava lamp idea you saw the blessing of things that's a membrane okay membranes confused together.\nAndrew Ippolito: They can blab off components so like, so this is a membrane a membrane can blab off a little thing called the vessel will learn about those all later, but just just get that in your mind now okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what we're going to do right now is a whirlwind tour of the prokaryotes we're not going to cover this in any great detail okay this class is about eukaryotes for the most part, if you want to learn more about prokaryotes could take Microbiology.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then you'll learn all about them. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so what we're going to do is keep this simple the pro carry on excel can be compartmentalised and the three basic regions there's the cell extensions there's the extracellular coverings and there's what's happening inside.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, not every cell has all these things on the outside, these are examples of things that you might find on the outside of it bacterial so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's start here with the cell extensions some cells will have what's called a sex peerless.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if this is one bacterial cell, and this is another bacterial cell, they can go through something called conjugation, which is when they will basically exchange genetic material.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they'll will do that through the sex Palace okay plural pilley.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some failure used for locomotion. Andrew Ippolito: The fin Bray are these hair like bristles that allow the bacterial cell to stick to surfaces okay 90% of bacteria exist in something called a biofilm.\nAndrew Ippolito: A biofilm is this very complex menagerie of different now say creatures different bacteria and fungus and sometimes proteus and they all kind of live in this collective group, if you take a shower and you notice that your mats a little slimy that's a biofilm.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the SLIME enos in your shower all the stuff in the crevices of the ceramic that's all biofilm.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, your teeth, right now, unless you brushed about a minute ago are already read establishing the biofilm of your teeth okay your teeth are covered and biofilm and now you can't stop thinking about.\nAndrew Ippolito: All that that's biofilm okay. Andrew Ippolito: The February, let the bacteria stick to it, so you can think about about yourselves just all these little hairs in there that stick the gate there may now low proteins that's the temporary.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, some bacteria have flagella singular flagellum.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so some of them have one, some of them have to some of them have a whole bunch coming out here and there's a whole world of flagella information i'm going to skip they have.\nAndrew Ippolito: Their flagella is completely different than eukaryotic flagella.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the bacterial for gel is made out of a protein called flagellation. Andrew Ippolito: And you character way more complicated will see those later in the Semester later at the end of this PowerPoint so Donna Wednesday.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so those are the adornments I feel like there's not that's that's the brain the six pillars.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now let's look at the coatings you'll see that there's a couple of coatings here we're not going to cover gram positive and gram negative and all that jazz instead what we're gonna do is this i'll draw a profile picture here Okay, so you have the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have something called the glycol calyx. Andrew Ippolito: Sorry, you have the cell wall first you have a cell wall and then you have a glycol calyx.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: The difference between gram positive and negative bacteria have to do with the cell wall and we're not going to go into that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So let's look look at the picture here this light blue thing that's the memory that's a fossil lifted by layer\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay prokaryotes lack. Andrew Ippolito: sterols and their membranes well remember cholesterol, remember, we learned about cholesterol cholesterol sits in the membrane that's that's unique to you carriers.\nAndrew Ippolito: And our can I think yeah see you carry back three don't have them in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, outside of the membrane sitting just up against it is the bacterial cell wall.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the cell walls made out of a substance called peptidoglycan.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, big long chains of sugars. Andrew Ippolito: with little cross-links of proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Its structure you don't have to know just you can just know the name and the fact that it's a combination of proteins sugars.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this cell wall is very strong compared to plant cell walls and fungus softballs.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason for that is very simple, the bacteria don't want to blow up wherever the factory is it's probably got water nearby and unless it has a thick cell wall, the the water would come into the cell from osmosis and blow it up.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the cell wall keeps the cell rigid and strong.\nAndrew Ippolito: outside of the cell wall is a is a.\nAndrew Ippolito: layer called the glycol calyx. Andrew Ippolito: Like okay Alex is made out of various polly sack rights, and it is very, very different depending on the species of bacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: But you can roughly compartmentalize them into two types or classify them into two types.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's either called a capsule. Andrew Ippolito: Which is a hard Shell around it think of it like an m&m.\nAndrew Ippolito: or something called a SLIME later. Think of it like a gummy bear.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, an encapsulated bacterium is a dangerous bacterium because usually the ones that can evade are immune system.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a process that we normally use called Figo psychosis which is eating it can evade Figo psychosis with this capsule.\nAndrew Ippolito: will learn more about that later and that's it that's that's the outside okay so to recap that there's the cells plasma membrane upon which a cell wall is built, and then beyond that is the sugar layer called the WikiLeaks.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the global kayla can either be goopy or it can be Sturdy.\nand protected. Andrew Ippolito: All right, let's talk about inside the cell now.\nAndrew Ippolito: The inside of the cell. Julia Lakchin: has no membranes within it.

April Neeld: it's one o'clock.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, is it. Andrew Ippolito: Already. Andrew Ippolito: Oh it's known as one or four that's even worse.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, let me finish this slide and we'll call it a day so get rid of them, he says it turns out the music zoom is an artifact of fixing the cells and to look at them under the microscope that they don't exist in nature, probably so don't even worry about this.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm inclusion bodies are just aggregates of proteins and other nutrients for storage to use for later.\nAndrew Ippolito: The rhizome is an engine to make proteins Milan about right with some of the more detail later.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the nuclear Lloyd is the bacterial chromosome that is organized with some chromosome proteins and so i'll teach you a new word here and then we'll call it a day chroma TIM.\nAndrew Ippolito: chromatin is what we call the complex of DNA plus proteins DNA is never found naked in the cell it's always complex with some proteins to scaffold it to organize it and to protect so we call them chromium binding protein protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: You might have heard that name histone histones or eukaryotic and are not bacteria they don't have those Okay, but there's proteins and so when you take the circular a chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excuse me there's a circular chromosome of DNA here so remember double stranded DNA we just learned about that take take a ring of it that's called a circular chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay prokaryotes have one circular chromosome that's there that's how their genome is stored Okay, the genome, of a pro carrier is housed within a single circular chromosome.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is complex, with DNA i'm sorry accomplished with proteins and kind of arranged in the semi organized thing that's called the nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's no membranes it's not under there's no nucleus, called the nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's usually hooked against the plasma membrane. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's pro carriers so here's just another picture, you can see that this is a.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a gram negative bacteria, you can see there's actually a double membrane the cell wall itself has another membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's that's what we're not we don't need to get into the complexities, this is Microbiology stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the the fundamental difference in a gram positive and gram negative bacterial cells, the gram negative cells have another memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have an outer membrane that is part of their cell wall Okay, so they have that peptidoglycan and then a layer of another membrane On top of that, whereas the gram positive bacteria lack that memory and they just have a very thick peptidoglycan layer\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and you can see here, this is the capsule that's the EU kayla capsule you can see right, so this picture, right here is a gram positive bacteria i'm sorry gram negative bacteria that's encapsulated and that's all i'll say about that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so where this is where we're going to pick up on Wednesday will learn about the end of symbiotic theory or set theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: And from there we'll do a tour of the eukaryotic cell mo be caught up or we're right where we need to be right now we're not behind anymore or exactly where we need, which is a good place to be.\nJulia Lakchin: And i'm going to meet.

Andrew Ippolito: Once upon a time, we had a planet.\nAndrew Ippolito: So when earth was first formed. Andrew Ippolito: It was like a pie in the oven the Center of the planet, was really, really molten this was all hot goopy mess.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: The way the chemistry worked was it would burp up gases from the Interior and that's how our atmosphere first came to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we we establish this atmosphere around the planet from the gases from within, and then gravity kept it there okay simultaneously for 500 million years asteroids pummeled the surface.\nAndrew Ippolito: 500 million years of nuclear war.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if life tried to evolve during that time it had no chance the hey look at me boom oh look at me boom hey i'm here boom right I missed to me seems like to me boom you guys ever watched.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah you know i'm talking about if you know who Mr Mrs anybody know Mr Mrs I must me seems like to me yeah that's one of my favorite cartoons ever I binge watched it over break oh my God.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's rick and morty For those of you who, if you haven't watched rick and morty rick and morty.\nAndrew Ippolito: Go see if you can stomach it some of us to me it's a cartoon but the way they draw things in there is not so comfortable, but the comedy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Man I channel rick sometimes by accident anyway earth 500 years nuclear war.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and the idea here is these asteroids probably brought the seeds of life, they probably brought some pre assembled building blocks, like some sugars like rainbows which we found out there, we found rainbows out in in asteroids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And amino acids, we found those two ribosome amino acids are everywhere in the cosmos it turns out, which is kind of crazy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Recently I read that i'm phosphate is rare in the cosmos and that the only way to get phosphate a certain supernova.\nAndrew Ippolito: That created and they spread out their their gas and so only the stars in that vicinity would get the phosphate so so life might not be as common as we think out in the cosmos but, in any case here on earth we got it, this is why so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Eventually the planet started cooling down enough so that the core of the planet, was small enough so we still have a molten core Earth is still cooling down to this day, we have a.\nAndrew Ippolito: slag the molten nickel core down here all the dense stuff fell to the bottom, basically, and this, as it spins, this is what gives rise to our magnetic field that protects us from all those crazy.\nAndrew Ippolito: cosmic rays, that would otherwise kill us right we got this fancy magnetic.\nAndrew Ippolito: field around us that help steer away those charged particles, so we don't die, which is kind of cool Mars doesn't have one of those that's part of the reason why life on Mars isn't really a good idea there's no magnet magnet magnetic sphere.\nAndrew Ippolito: So anyway. Andrew Ippolito: The early atmosphere of earth was anoxic anoxic meaning it had no oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and it was a highly reducing environment. Andrew Ippolito: will learn about what reduction is later in the Semester, but the idea is is it has.\nAndrew Ippolito: The ability to push electrons on to things. yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: I should say it's it yeah pushed into it favors the electrons moving, so it favors favors chemistry and favors the movement of the chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the first things that probably evolved more RNA RNA molecules are probably the first bio polymer on the planet.\nAndrew Ippolito: poly peptides are probably also assembling this was all just on the surface two dimensional the ocean Oh well, that's great so then it ring for another couple I think 10s of millions of years it rain.\nAndrew Ippolito: It rained a lot so as earth was cooling. Andrew Ippolito: The water vapor would condense forming clouds and then it rained.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and that water was probably also carried along by these comments that held down on us and some of the water from the inside, so we've got we got an atmosphere.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm sorry we got we got water and it rained for so many years that eventually the oceans came to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so now, we had the earth spinning.

Andrew Ippolito: Either the one of the one of the current models is this this called the oil droplet hypothesis, the idea that fossil lipids and and all the other building blocks, instead of having a membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first promo cells were probably little droplets of oily stuff that had RNA in it and they were able to replicate and some of the experiments they've done with this show like, if you take an oil droplet.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the. Andrew Ippolito: They get too big, they eventually start to disperse them break apart, and so it turns out the sizes of these droplets are about the same size as a bacterial cell so there's something in the physics of all these systems that get you that size.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then eventually they get encapsulated by this festival goodbye. Andrew Ippolito: So we're not sure which came first the droplet part, like the cytoplasm or the plasma membrane right in any case Luca comes out of all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is our last universal common ancestor right now, there were probably other cells, there was another competition there was something going on and Luca one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that that whole epoch of time before Luca is hidden from us and we'll never know anything about it because there's zero trace of any of it, there is no chemical evidence there's definitely no fossils right and earth was wiping itself out over and over again, from all the meteors.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, all we can do is conjecture at this point so everything I just told you, is conjecture based on data that we have and and experiments, we ran the lab there's a Uri geller experiment which you'll learn about someday in another class next semester.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so the first cells on earth, as they started waking up we're basking in the sunlight.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they give rise to really two kinds of cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: The head or a trophy.\nAndrew Ippolito: By hetero truth, this is a cell it eats other cells.

Andrew Ippolito: geologists see this crust that permeates the entire planet that's rust belt.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that is what we associate with what we call the oxygen revolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: The oxygen revolution is when the oxygen just kept coming from the photo synthesizers and all the iron got used up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's think about it i'm spewing oxygen it's interacting with the iron it's trapping them and rust it goes down.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it's taking it out of play right, so, in other words the atmosphere is still safe for everything else on until the rust is used up until the iron is used up that's when we start seeing a very rapid increase in oxygen levels.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this probably triggered some kind of mass extinction of all the anaerobic life on the planet.\nAndrew Ippolito: But life finds a way right. Andrew Ippolito: As Malcolm said in Jurassic Park life life finds a way.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, and so. Andrew Ippolito: There were some cells that figured out the secrets of oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: They can use it to their advantage now here's the thing we learned about oxygen at the chemical level, and we know that oxygen has those fancy pair of loan electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And all i'm going to tell you is that weird electron configuration of oxygen is what allows oxygen to be used.\nAndrew Ippolito: As. Andrew Ippolito: A very potent driver of chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in the realm of energy dynamics, in other words the cells, were able to harness the power of oxygen to use it in their chemistry.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what oxygens capable of doing. Andrew Ippolito: is very strongly.\nAndrew Ippolito: attract electrons to it. Andrew Ippolito: So just imagine you have this like crazy strong magnet.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a piece of paper. Andrew Ippolito: And then, on the other side of the paper you put some iron filings on it, you can imagine the magnet pushing all those iron filings onto the paper and applying a force to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Pulling on it that's kind of how you can see oxygen doing it's heavy lifting it's capable of sucking electrons downhill, and in that process it's able to do work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so these first cells that figured out how to use oxygen the first Arabs.\nAndrew Ippolito: roebuck life arose.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's say that this guy right here he's happy because he's making all this money.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, he figured out he got lucky, and he didn't just go to school and work hard, but he got lucky and got a job that makes him pay a lot of money right and this guy over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: doesn't have a lot of money.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we know that, whenever you set up a story where there's two guys next to each other and one's got more money than the other, he is going to try to steal his money.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's just how it goes so translate that to the cellular story here you got cells that can't make a lot of energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so these an aerobic bacteria or whatever they're called back then they can take a glucose molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when they eat glucose they get they can make two ATP molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is about 2% of the energy trapped in glucose okay so think of this as sustenance living.\nAndrew Ippolito: This guy he was able to figure out oxygen with that same single glucose molecule he's able to produce about 30 ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: which represents about 30% of the energy and glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so. Andrew Ippolito: And so, what do you think's going to happen, imagine there's there's somebody walking down this dark alleyway in the bad part of New York City.\nAndrew Ippolito: yelling at the top of his lungs i'm rich and just throwing hundred dollar bills around.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and everybody around him the ones that aren't so rich are going to come out and be like what's going on here and sure they might pick up some of the money but they're going to realize let's just capture this guy.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's go put them in a warehouse and just keep throwing this money out at us and that's pretty much what happened so watch this sells beat each other, this is a very normal thing cells each other through a process will call Figo psychosis Vigo means eat or food psychosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: finger psychosis, which is a specialized form of what we call endo psychosis cellular so basically if this is a cell, and this is a thing in the environment that cell will.\nAndrew Ippolito: Imagine it's membrane this thing will come in and eventually encapsulated and close it off, so that the thing is now trapped inside the cell in something called the finger zoom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so it basically it's like take some part of the membrane and blab it off and track things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that's how cells eat things like just them, and so here's a cell, that is an Anna robe and here is a cell, that is an Arab let's draw him and blue okay he's the rich guy.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the header a trophy normally eat each other, he eats him. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's bring him in how would that look well here's the membrane component.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then here, he is. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and here's the thing he doesn't die.\nAndrew Ippolito: He doesn't get digested. He stays there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he realizes hey you know what it's kind of safe in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not out not harsh environment. Andrew Ippolito: But i'm in this warm warm cozy environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And i'm going to keep producing all my money. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the cell that eat them says, you know I could either kill them and eat them now, or I just let them sit there and he's producing all this energy for me and on the horse, this is the first instance of domestication.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, instead of killing the cow and eaten it he put the count of penalties milking it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And right there that thing here that I just drew that's essentially the mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: The mitochondria has to membranes that outer membrane and the inner membrane that has all those imaginations will explain why those are there later, but there you go there's a cell inside of a thing that's why it's got to membranes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And right remember DNA right everything's got a genome so let's throw this in yellow here, so this cell came whether it's a pro periodic cell it's got a circular DNA genome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so it's still in there and guess what the mitochondria has it's got a little circular DNA genome that looks just like a pro carry out excel.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it produces its own rhizomes. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's just put this list here, so we got we got a circular circular DNA.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we got probiotic Dr isms. Andrew Ippolito: Your mitochondria have rhizomes in them that are small, like bacterial rob ISM.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so we call this endo Sim oops endo.\nAndrew Ippolito: symbiotic theory. Andrew Ippolito: endo inside symbiotic mutual relationship mutually beneficial relationship.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and here's the thing this happens. Andrew Ippolito: Again and again and again, so this cell here, the one that eat this mitochondria of the cell that eat this, and now we will say it's got a what we'll call mitochondria in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, let's do this now. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, think about for a minute, if you had a person that earned $100 a week imagine that person's lifestyle and in in Philadelphia right how big would their apartment be."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 6 (Part 2) - The Cells","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=L14C8WILP8q1Oj14","chunkTitle":"Diversification of Eukaryotes","chunkSummary":"Explanation of the diversification of eukaryotes into different lineages, including algae, protozoa, plants, fungi, and animals.","start":"22:03","end":"27:02","content":"Andrew Ippolito: What would they what would they be eating for dinner right they probably don't have a car MAC and cheese, or maybe ramen noodles ramen noodles and they have an apartment that's the size of like my office.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so so there's your prob carrier there's the one up here that was earning to https for glucose molecule that's your hundred dollars a day or $100 a week.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, give that same sell a sudden constant supply of energy right somebody scratches off and wins the lottery now they have $10,000 a week.\nAndrew Ippolito: The question no longer is what they're eating for dinner that's a question for chef.\nAndrew Ippolito: The question isn't do they have a car, not their question is is how many cars, do they have right, in other words, when somebody gets rich quick and they have all this money coming in their life gets very complicated.\nAndrew Ippolito: The complexity of their life increases. Andrew Ippolito: that's why you carry out some more complicated because they can be they have all this extra energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is the rise of the eukaryotic cell. Andrew Ippolito: This is how you carry its evolved through this into somebody else's now this cell here there's another pro charismatic cell over here.\nAndrew Ippolito: That learned how to make their own sugar. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this thing is producing glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, he gets eaten to. Andrew Ippolito: nom nom nom.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you see how that happened twice now, so this is what we call it cereal and oh symbiotic theory and that's why it's called set theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this all right here here's your plan. Andrew Ippolito: Really there's there's your let's call him analogy right now that's algae because that's a protest, you probably still swims around.\nAndrew Ippolito: That algae gave rise to the plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Angela Harbeck: So set theory is just to sell eating a bunch of other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, you can just tell it to that basic yeah. Andrew Ippolito: It is selling other cells and the cells not dying.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are you so let's go look at the slide now let's go to the slide over here alright so here is the first where's my little here's the first promo cell right there for it not produce all the first pro eukaryotic cell so it's it notice has a nucleus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so, so this is something new, this isn't approved carry oh it's not really there's no mitochondria there's no license zones there's there's just there's just a nucleus, and the er.\nAndrew Ippolito: This cell eats another cell and, by the way the graphic artist who drew this got this wrong you see how this mitochondria right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This, this is an example of a lazy graphic artist he drew mitochondria or she drew mitochondria they drew mitochondria and.\nAndrew Ippolito: They copy and pasted it and used it twice there, but really that second membrane the outermost membrane doesn't exist, yet this is how I want you to think of it here's the original cell here's the original setup eat it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when this comes in here, and this bulbs off and traps it that outer membrane comes from the membrane of the cell, so this outer membrane here comes from this memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is wrong, the way they drew it, but whatever details details, so this cell here eats the cell here and there's your mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then that so goes along and so some of those cells not wasn't just one cell right there's billions of cells here, so the next thing that happens is this cell here that's got a mitochondria goes and eats another cell this photosynthetic pro carrier.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now you give birth now you give rise to the photosynthetic eukaryotes Okay, and so this will be classified as the beginning of the algae.\nAndrew Ippolito: This would be giving rise to the beginnings of the proto zones.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they go and then they are all these things diversify there's different kinds of algae there's different kinds of proto zones and one lineage of those protozoa goes and gives rise to the episode the cons.\nAndrew Ippolito: In other words, they figure out multicellular charity and the pistol cons, then in turn give rise to the fungus and the animals.\nAndrew Ippolito: The algae some of them figure things out and give rise to the plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so that's the basic story of life. Andrew Ippolito: You carry us or procure us keep eating each other that gives rise to the algae and the proto zones which then give rise to the multicellular kingdoms that we know today."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 6 (Part 2) - The Cells","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=L14C8WILP8q1Oj14","chunkTitle":"Conclusion","chunkSummary":"Wrap-up of the lecture and the significance of endosymbiosis in the evolution of life on Earth.","start":"27:15","end":"29:32","content":"Alexa DePrisco: Excuse me, yes, so this is not necessarily observed today this is like a cell evolution theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah we so what we do observe today. Andrew Ippolito: And, and we see numerous pieces of evidence that this continues to happen is this idea of endo symbiosis so, for example, if you look at coral.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay i've been those coral reefs the animal coral has that lives with inside of it a symbiotic that photo synthesizes, which is what gives called the beautiful colors and when Carl gets bleached when you talk about coral bleaching.\nAndrew Ippolito: When the pH or the temperature of the environment for a coral reef gets on favorable the coral basically the animal rejects it's symbiotic.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's called the zoo's Anthony I believe it says there's actually get out you're not welcome here anymore you're not you know you're not doing your part you're not photosynthesizing you're just a waste of space go.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, those are the actually kind of drips his head walks away like Charlie Brown and and so what's left is this white, but still living coral.\nAndrew Ippolito: Depending on if the environment very rapidly gets back to a happy place the coral might bring back that Suzanne saline and keep living, but the problem is if it stays out too long.\nAndrew Ippolito: That coral can't survive too long, without it, because what the corals doing during the day when the sun's out is it's eating the food from those whose Anthony and then nighttime when it's dark it's eating things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so coral does, both because of the symbiotic so we see the symbiosis everywhere in nature, and we see it, numerous times there's there's also eukaryotes that have eaten other you carriers.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we can see these weird specialized organelles that are essentially shriveled up reasons of former eukaryotic cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: one place, you see those in the golden algae. Andrew Ippolito: If you want to study this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right, so I just wrote I lectured too long there I do it again, but hopefully it was that story interesting at least.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right i'm done blabbing let's let's draw let's doodles themselves now or any any questions are there any questions on Saturday.\nJulia Lakchin: I have a quick question, and maybe the question but.

Andrew Ippolito: The word itself a header a trophy is an organism that acquires its energy from outside of itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: As opposed to an auditor growth that acquires this. Andrew Ippolito: Energy when I say acquire let me refine that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's food right and there's energy so there's the building blocks, you know you need carbon and hydrogen and all that, and then you also need the energy to put them together right so there's there's energy and resources.\nAndrew Ippolito: So an otter troth versus a header a truth that trophy ISM that's where do we get our high.\nEnergy. Andrew Ippolito: molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: We either make them we either make our own food like what a plant those right, so they take the energy from the sun.\nJulia Lakchin: And they. Andrew Ippolito: pump it into a molecule, so now we can make sugars right or.\nAndrew Ippolito: As a header trophy I need to acquire that molecule from the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you can distill it all as a simple thought, where do we get my sugar.\nAndrew Ippolito: I either make it myself or I go and I hunted. Andrew Ippolito: or.\nAndrew Ippolito: find it in the environment, so the head retrofit acquire their their food from the environment, the audit trails make their own food.\nJulia Lakchin: Okay got it okay. Andrew Ippolito: You can think of food, as both the energy and the material.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then vitamins when when we talk about nutrients right, so you don't just eat food we think about food and nutrients right, so the nutrients are things like the phosphate or the.\nAndrew Ippolito: iron that kind of stuff right vitamins vitamins aren't you don't we don't take vitamins your body to with the intent to break them down and get energy out of them Okay, we use vitamins to do other work in the metabolism, so we need food nutrients and the food comes along with it energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so audit trump's make their own food, but still need to acquire nutrients from the Environment that's why you have to put plants in soil right they need to get the nitrogen and phosphorus out of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we get all of it from our food the plants just get their nutrients they make their own food from the sun and the carbon dioxide in the water okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's let's gear up to the point we're gonna start drawing eukaryotic cell okay so there's a couple concepts here, the first is, is the reason why do you carry on so big.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, therefore, if you just think of the volume of space that takes up compared to the volume inside of it."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 6 (Part 2) - The Cells","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=L14C8WILP8q1Oj14","chunkTitle":"Surface Area to Volume Ratio","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of surface area to volume ratio and its importance in biology.

Andrew Ippolito: you're doing until we maximize our surface area.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that's why the inside of the eukaryotic cell so crazy complicated all the surfaces.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right now, some of the cell wall on the outside it turns out all of life, except animals.\nAndrew Ippolito: All of life, except animals and and some proteins have a strong exterior wall that protects them the plants have cell walls, the fungus have cell walls, a lot of the algae have cell walls all the bacteria have cell walls, we don't have cell walls.\nAndrew Ippolito: What is going on there, but it turns out the Meta zones, the animals treated the safety of the cell wall for flexibility and movement alright, we move, we can move like no other organism on the planet that's one of the things that animals can do some better than others."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 6 (Part 2) - The Cells","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=L14C8WILP8q1Oj14","chunkTitle":"The Nucleus and Cytoplasm","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the nucleus as a protective shell around the genome.

Andrew Ippolito: which requires energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the maintenance of the homeostasis right so maintaining homeostasis means keeping that internal environment different from the outside, which makes sense right because of the inside the outside of the Environment we're all the same, then there'd be nothing there there's no life.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can start to understand like what life actually is now you can't really define it still but one of the things that makes life life is this idea of a pattern establishing and maintaining a pattern of some kind that's that's distinct from the surroundings like an ocean wave.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then we review this concept of cell size as a reminder, we talked about this at the beginning of Chapter six this idea that cells are small, because they need to be able to quickly interact with their environment and they can only do this at the memory.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: We talked about how cells are built you in particular we're going to use eukaryotic cells as a model for our discussions, because.\nAndrew Ippolito: You carry out eukaryotes are the ones that this entire class focuses on as opposed to like a Microbiology class.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why the eukaryotic cell so big remember is because of all of these internal membranes right So if you just picked a random spot on the screen there.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're never too far away from a membrane you're never too far away from the ability to.\nAndrew Ippolito: move something in or out of something so there's all of these environments that we've established.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's also review and remind ourselves of the fossil lip itself, this is back from chapter for now Chapter five."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 1) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=e4qH5ZMukfBXxThE","chunkTitle":"Cell Size and Membrane Function","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the relationship between cell size and membrane function.","start":"5:25","end":"6:43","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And it's also review and remind ourselves of the fossil lip itself, this is back from chapter for now Chapter five.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea of this empty Philip are empathic molecule that has both the polar head and the hydrophobic tales that allows us to establish the gradient i'm sorry allows us to establish remembering, to begin with.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we have we have the fossil it but and all the different kinds of possibilities.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the way they interact remember there's the entirely flood and the outer leaflet right so that's that's going to be our.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our starting point here, and the fact that there's cholesterol on the membrane remember the cholesterol stabilizes the membrane we've talked a little bit about that.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll talk more about that today.

Andrew Ippolito: hey don't don't let those people poison themselves you poison yourself for them and we'll pay you a little bit of money for that not too much, though.\nTaylor Campbell: So it's not good when it gets on you right. Andrew Ippolito: Now that said.\nAndrew Ippolito: A little bit of guests on your hands every once in a while it's fine if you're working with guests, every day, and you get it on your hands every day that's not fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's a good rule of thumb for your life for working in lab if you get a little bit of something on your hands just depending on what it is, I mean there's some things that even a little bit of it will do some permanent damage.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the vast like a little bit of virus little bit of virus never heard anyone right we know that's that's not true, it off that's that's so very wrong now.\nAndrew Ippolito: But, but most most things in the lab you know you're not going to do, permission or harm to yourself it's a little bit of it gets on your hands.\nAndrew Ippolito: and get you can pump pump your own gas if you get a little on your hand they don't wear rubber gloves when you're using the gas pump you don't have to go see Dr me here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but if you're in the garage and you're pouring gas in your lawn mower every week and you're done and all over the place, the first of all you're doing something wrong, you should learn how to pour gas in your lamar.\nAndrew Ippolito: But uh but if you're getting that all over your hands every week that's not right, if your dad's in the garage every week doing that that's not good for him either he's by this point i've been doing that for years, so you might want to stop doing that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what I want you to do now is to think of the game there's things outside the cell that can get in and there's things out so this other kick it and what are they Okay, so let me throw somebody how about how about."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 1) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=e4qH5ZMukfBXxThE","chunkTitle":"Integral and Peripheral Membrane Proteins","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the difference between integral and peripheral membrane proteins and their roles in transporting molecules across the membrane.","start":"13:06","end":"21:58","content":"Andrew Ippolito: So what I want you to do now is to think of the game there's things outside the cell that can get in and there's things out so this other kick it and what are they Okay, so let me throw somebody how about how about.\nAndrew Ippolito: approaching. Andrew Ippolito: Like insulin and insulin just pass through the membrane, what do you think.\nAndrew Ippolito: No good. Taylor Campbell: too big. Andrew Ippolito: Right, what if what if I took insulin and I made it completely electrically neutral how about now.\nTaylor Campbell: it's still too. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: Right so it's so the most important variable is how big things are.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now it's small than the next question you're asking yourself as well as charged or not, how about polar molecules What about polar molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: So ariana you're saying know. Andrew Ippolito: what's your what's your thought process there. Arianna Siliverdis: So don't they have to be non polar.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because I said that because I said so right, but so instead of just following the strict rule there why why why can't polar things get across the membrane.\nArianna Siliverdis: What didn't mess up like the charge of what's already been established.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you say mess up the charge of what. Andrew Ippolito: The molecule or the cell. Arianna Siliverdis: Of the cell okay.\nSo. Andrew Ippolito: By mess up What do you mean. Arianna Siliverdis: Well, if it was already a specific charge and you're adding new things with opposite charges it's going to change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh okay I I like that idea but here's here's the truth of it, the.\nAndrew Ippolito: insides of I want to say. Andrew Ippolito: All that's a dangerous word, but the insides of all eukaryotic cells Okay, so this is a eukaryotic cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: The inside of the cell tends to be more negative than the outside, and the reason for that is there's a pump that will talk about the sodium potassium pump and what the sodium potassium pump does is it establishes and maintains that electrical gradient.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's an electrical gradient that cells establish right so now, you can imagine the inside of the cells negative and we have this polar molecule here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Can you imagine that, as it gets a little closer to this if it's polarity is also a little negative it's going to act kind of like a magnet pulling a wave pushing away from another another magnet right it's going to literally pushed away if this is slightly negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's just there's gonna be a little bit of a repulsion not too much, but a little bit likewise if it's a little bit positive, what do you think's going to happen then would it go in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember that the the heads of foster lipids are polar.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's going to happen to a positively charged thing. Andrew Ippolito: Can those go in.\nZachary Lucas: Those just be attracted to them, they give the charge of the philosophy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excellent. Andrew Ippolito: So, in other words, positive charge things are going to stick. Andrew Ippolito: To the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's use red So you can see, this better they're going to stick to the membrane they're not going in either good.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it turns out, as we'll see later in the Semester. Andrew Ippolito: Member H plus number of protons and pH and all that so protons will actually accumulate along the surface of a membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so here's the rule charged molecules. Andrew Ippolito: And polar molecules to not get into the cell, they do not pass a membrane a membrane is impermeable to them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the easiest way to think of all this is to think of the one case of things that can get in.\nAndrew Ippolito: and commit that to memory and then you can into it or logic your way to everything else, and that is small uncharged particles can freely go across the memory, the membrane is permeable to non polar small molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: What about medium sized. molecules. Angela Harbeck: yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: hold on a second yeah what's up buddy watch TV know.\nAndrew Ippolito: He knew the answer to that before he asked he just wanted to make me look bad in front of you guys. Andrew Ippolito: that's kind of like number one you're a little and you're like hey mommy can Bobby eat dinner over tonight and like you asked in front of Bobby and if mom says no, then she's a jerk and so, of course, yes, say yes that's what he just did.\nAndrew Ippolito: But I don't care, I can look like a jerk he still can watch TV.\nAndrew Ippolito: They watch so much TV lately anyway right jack.\nAndrew Ippolito: He said what I thought he might have been eavesdropping. that's just paranoia that's just.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so so right you got the rules of the game that's it it's that simple alright, so now here's my next question to you well, how do we get things.\nAndrew Ippolito: That are impermeable across the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: What do you think. Andrew Ippolito: Energy okay well it's like brute force just shove, it in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: just put push it really hard until I mean I guess that i'm sure there's some mechanism somewhere in biology that just.\nAndrew Ippolito: brute forces it in there, but so. Andrew Ippolito: Like I like that I like energy okay yeah but but.\nAndrew Ippolito: The woody, what are we going to do with that energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right yeah i'm not really sure here all right well so here i'm going to give you a little hand remember when we learned about the rough er what was special about the rough endoplasmic reticulum What did it do.\nAngela Harbeck: It had Dr is a. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and what the ripe isms do. Angela Harbeck: They produce protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good what kinds of proteins to the ripe isms make in the rough year.\nAndrew Ippolito: How deep this rabbit hole go Angela. Andrew Ippolito: How far can you get your although you're all the way there that's right that's exactly where I wanted you now let's see if we can go further.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's remember that there were different kinds of proteins in the cell. Andrew Ippolito: That we produce right, so the cell the rhizomes that are out in the situs cytoplasm make all the proteins and just float around and Bob around and do other jobs, the rough er makes specialized kind of proteins right there's two kinds of proteins, that the rough er makes anybody remember.\nThe beginning, one of the two. Andrew Ippolito: got Alexis. Alexis Micewski: Secret sick I can't pronounce the word.\nAndrew Ippolito: ready Secretary proteins. yeah. Andrew Ippolito: Good okay that's one what's the other one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Angela did that trigger your memory, a little bit there's there's there's something sitting now okay that's fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody. Alexa Deprisco: Like the memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so Tyler said, like okay technically you're right and that's the best kind of correct.\nAndrew Ippolito: glycoproteins are created by the rough er the glide constellation part So if you guys remember glycoproteins are proteins that have a sugar on them.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have a sugar modi attached to them and attachment happens and the goal G right remember the goals the apparatus so so what that glycol protein in order to do what it's doing there, what kind of protein is a glycoproteins with respect to membranes.\nApril. Andrew Ippolito: you're answering my question, I know how you're like i'm just gonna say it out loud, to see how it sounds if I like it then i'll mute myself, though, because I want to hear.\nApril Neeld: What was your thought process there. April Neeld: Well, I kind of saw one lizzie pilot and she said structure structure proteins, so I was thinking of like that kind of sounds right like structural proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay okay so. Andrew Ippolito: kind of kind of it's even more general than that remember so there's there's there's seibel proteins and structural or you're thinking of maybe the filament proteins like acted and stuff yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what about proteins that get actually put in the membrane that's what we're going for here remember I described that some of the proteins, that the rub is a mix and the rough er stitched into the.\nAndrew Ippolito: membrane and I drew this. Andrew Ippolito: Number this. Andrew Ippolito: Number the stitching like that we stitch the protein into the membrane they're called integral membrane proteins.\nAngela Harbeck: Can you spell that. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, it's actually it's on the slide, let me just go to the. slide."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 1) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=e4qH5ZMukfBXxThE","chunkTitle":"Protein Carriers and Channels","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the role of protein carriers and channels in facilitating the transport of molecules across the cell membrane.","start":"21:58","end":"30:53","content":"Angela Harbeck: Can you spell that. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, it's actually it's on the slide, let me just go to the. slide.\nTo do skip all this right now. Andrew Ippolito: I was trying to teach you guys in a more active way i'd rather just mindlessly go to the PowerPoint here where's the word.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here we go here we go alright So these are the kinds of proteins that interact with membranes there's integral proteins and what that means.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the poly peptide chain is literally stitched into the membrane at the time it's made by the ribosome so as arrive isms going through translation and that polly peptides getting extended that polly pets are getting directed into the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your book actually goes into some details there that's beyond the scope so that's why this study guides useful that you don't have to know the level of detail that the book was into there.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK okay so there's integral proteins and then there's another class of protein called a peripheral protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: By peripheral the English word peripheral means nearby. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so so like jack right now, if he was standing literally right here, you can kind of see him and kind of not he'd be peripheral to the screen, they just right next to so a peripheral protein to doodle that if this is the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: An integral protein with thread through the membrane a peripheral protein would just kind of like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Most into it a little bit like a really comfy pillow and putting your head on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: or like in finding Nemo the way clownfish interact with the anemones you kind of like tuck in there, so you can kind of there that's a peripheral protein because they can easily come out again.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay integral proteins are permanently stitched into the membrane you can't get them out, and they so they once they're there they're there.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So let's let's talk just for a second about integral proteins here.\nAndrew Ippolito: integral proteins have so have I introduced this concept called a domain to get a protein domain, we talked about those yet anybody remember no.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, a protein them and just a part of the protein it's a functionally distinct part of the protein we've learned that proteins have that primary structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: We fold it up, and yet the various secondary structures and then they have this overall 3D structure that that tertiary right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when we consider the tertiary structure of a protein, we can see that protein as a machine that has different regions of it like so think think of your body right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: everything's continuous right your head as a test your shoulders and your arms and your legs and your torso So if I talked about your head.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or, I talked about your finger or your arm right, you would call this your head domain your leg domain your elbow domain or really your arm domain right, so the domain is just a functionally distinct part of a protein so.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I have a trans trans an integral membrane protein also called the Trans membrane protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's do this let's pretend this got a doodle like this and, like this and, like this that are so I just drew a bunch of Africa policies and stuff right, so this part of the protein here that's outside the cell, that is, the extracellular domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay inside the cells part is the intra cellular domain. Andrew Ippolito: Be so here's the here's my question to you guys which part of the protein would a hormone bind to or if this was so if this was a receptor on the cell membrane which part of the protein which domain on the protein would be the part that binds to the important signaling molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: The extracellular domain right the one on the outside sure Okay, and the middle part here that's called the Trans membrane domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Number trans means across right system transformers transformers one it's, on the other side, the trans membrane domain goes through the membrane it goes across the memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can imagine if I took the primary sequence of this protein and we looked.\nAndrew Ippolito: At the you know the 40 amino acids that are making up that extracellular domain we'd probably find polar amino acids and maybe even charged amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if we looked at that stretch of membrane i'm sorry if we looked at that stretch of the sequence that goes across the membrane we'd probably find a bunch of hydrophobic non charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: nonpolar amino acids and then we'd see another stretch of charge ones on the inside and sure enough when a scientist reads through a protein sequence they're looking for stuff like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're looking for regions of hydrophobic and hydrophobic amino acids in there and that's the telltale sign that you found it integral membrane protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: And some of these proteins will actually span the memory, not just once, like this, but they will literally stitch across it several times.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when you think of the sequence there let's let's just mark your mark these three those parts of the protein go across the membrane right if I pull That apart, and I looked at just the primary structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: I would see. Andrew Ippolito: These alternating regions of hydrophobic hydrophobic stretches of amino acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does that make sense. April Neeld: question. April Neeld: yeah good so, is it is a purging either an interval protein our peripheral or can there be one that's like kind of both.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's a great Question No it's one or the other. April Neeld: Okay yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then I guess the third kind of protein that we're not talking about would be will not just like in the cell hanging out right, and you can call those you can call that a.\nAndrew Ippolito: call a soluble protein, I suppose. Andrew Ippolito: Her so there's soluble.\nAndrew Ippolito: But really they're called globular it's a fun word color there globs right there called kolob you learn proteins so there's really all proteins can be loosely classified into two kinds filament is in globular.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right basically does if you put it in water what happens to it, is it like albumin like an egg white and it's goofy or is it like hair on the top of your water.\nAngela Harbeck: let's globular protein. Andrew Ippolito: So globular protein is a protein that. soluble in solution.\nAndrew Ippolito: So site a solid proteins, the proteins that are bopping around inside your cell running your metabolism Those are all the most of them are enzymes, those are globular protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and if it's part of the site with skeleton it's you know filament those are filament is proteins okay so they're like they're soluble or they're not soluble that's that's the rough way of categorizing protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay alright, so now that you understand that let's talk about the ones that let's go back to the membrane now okay so here's my question again.\nAndrew Ippolito: How do we get something across that membrane that otherwise is impermeable to it like a like a reasonably sized protein or hey how about this glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, you know that you're selling these to eat glucose but glucose is too big to get across and it's polar so, how does glucose get into the cell.\nAlexis Micewski: Protein carries it. Andrew Ippolito: yeah exactly. Andrew Ippolito: there's there's this whole world of proteins called protein carriers there's carriers there's so they're called carrier proteins and there's things, called channels.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's channel proteins and there's carrier proteins, so the difference is the Channel protein think of the word channel, not in the sense of changing the Channel on your TV, but a channel like the English Channel.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right a a pathway or a corridor through something so a channel protein literally creates.\nAndrew Ippolito: a hole in the membrane and I can't draw today because it remember my this whole thing is broken so that's why everything is like messy and weird I mean just look at the PowerPoint here there, right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that guy right there that's a channel protein. Andrew Ippolito: It literally creates a tunnel for something to get through, they are specific to whatever's coming in, so there are things like chloride channels.\nAndrew Ippolito: That would be an example, a chloride channel. Andrew Ippolito: there's also the sodium potassium pump right So what do you think the differences between me calling something a channel versus a pump.\nAngela Harbeck: channel just allows it to go through or it's like on a court, and that will pump kind of pushes it through our out."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 1) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=e4qH5ZMukfBXxThE","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Membrane Permeability","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the concept of membrane permeability and its importance in cellular processes.

Andrew Ippolito: This is the third.\nAndrew Ippolito: The third. Andrew Ippolito: functional. Andrew Ippolito: Area of a cell right we focus last chapter Chapter six we focused on the inside of the cell, we talked about the cytoplasm MC components, we talked about the nucleus now we're going to talk about the memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is arguably the most important part of this cell, because this is the boundary of life right, so what the memory does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is. Andrew Ippolito: It selectively allow some things to come in and some things to go out and attract some things within and prevent some things from getting in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so. Andrew Ippolito: The idea here is, we have an internal environment that is different from the outside.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to establish that difference and we're going to maintain that difference and that's what homeostasis really is at the cellular level.\nAndrew Ippolito: establishing and maintaining. Andrew Ippolito: You can think of them as greediness concentration.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we talked about this a little bit. Andrew Ippolito: In the last chapter at the beginning of it, the idea of self size, so this is here just to review the idea that cells are small, because they have to continually.\nAndrew Ippolito: interact with their environment, and the only place, they can do that interaction. Andrew Ippolito: Is at the memory.\nYes, there is supposed to be something on the screen.\nAndrew Ippolito: There it is, I thought I was sharing my screen um let's roll back here alright, so you guys are just listening to the sound of my voice looking at darkness okay so let's start here we go so there's a membrane Okay, and you can see there's the external environment and the internal environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the idea is some things are allowed in and some things are allowed out and some things are trapped in and some things are trapped out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so in this game here. Andrew Ippolito: which requires energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the maintenance of the homeostasis right so maintaining homeostasis means keeping that internal environment different from the outside, which makes sense right because of the inside the outside of the Environment we're all the same, then there'd be nothing there there's no life.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can start to understand like what life actually is now you can't really define it still but one of the things that makes life life is this idea of a pattern establishing and maintaining a pattern of some kind that's that's distinct from the surroundings like an ocean wave.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then we review this concept of cell size as a reminder, we talked about this at the beginning of Chapter six this idea that cells are small, because they need to be able to quickly interact with their environment and they can only do this at the memory.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: We talked about how cells are built you in particular we're going to use eukaryotic cells as a model for our discussions, because.\nAndrew Ippolito: You carry out eukaryotes are the ones that this entire class focuses on as opposed to like a Microbiology class.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why the eukaryotic cell so big remember is because of all of these internal membranes right So if you just picked a random spot on the screen there.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're never too far away from a membrane you're never too far away from the ability to.\nAndrew Ippolito: move something in or out of something so there's all of these environments that we've established.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's also review and remind ourselves of the fossil lip itself, this is back from chapter for now Chapter five.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea of this empty Philip are empathic molecule that has both the polar head and the hydrophobic tales that allows us to establish the gradient i'm sorry allows us to establish remembering, to begin with.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so we have we have the fossil it but and all the different kinds of possibilities.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the way they interact remember there's the entirely flood and the outer leaflet right so that's that's going to be our.\nAndrew Ippolito: Our starting point here, and the fact that there's cholesterol on the membrane remember the cholesterol stabilizes the membrane we've talked a little bit about that.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'll talk more about that today. Andrew Ippolito: And the fact that when you put these fossil lipids into water, depending on the temperature and the pH and the liquid concentration and the Ionic concentrations, they can form these different types of structures.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right now, this, this is a slide is all text like I hate all tech slides, but this is a slide you can review this establishes the rules of the game.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so i'm gonna skip this slide use this for your studying, I think this is in the study guide to but, instead, what I want to do is, I want to go to the whiteboard now.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I have to share my whiteboard screen.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's where I want to do a little bit of active learning for you, because the one thing I want you to get out of this lecture right now is is the the rules of the game, so to speak.\nAndrew Ippolito: I really have to reboot my computer.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can't write like this oh my gosh hold on just want to zoom in to something around here is where.\nAndrew Ippolito: But my wife and graphic driver. that's why.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is me trying to draw a circle. Andrew Ippolito: I can't draw circles.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, just give me one second. Andrew Ippolito: i'm gonna try to.\nAndrew Ippolito: shut down doing the control alt delete and.\nThere it is.\nAnything with it. Andrew Ippolito: Please work, please tablet drivers not responding turn off your computer and turn it on again nevermind i'm not i'm not nevermind I can do this with a broken tablet so rules just.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's two variables charge. Andrew Ippolito: And size.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is me teaching you chess this is me teaching you basic rules and then we're going to apply these rules to problems okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we're all one. Andrew Ippolito: Big things can't get in the cell that's obvious.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the easy rule right it just makes sense big things can't get in it can't just leak into this remember that the membrane being this phosphor lifted by layer\nAndrew Ippolito: Right this isn't a solid this isn't like a protein code Okay, this is like more like an oil layer so something so big things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Will physically just not be able to get through that little things okay little things that are uncharged that are non polar they can literally pass through the membrane like it's not even there.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 1) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=e4qH5ZMukfBXxThE","chunkTitle":"Passive Transport: Diffusion and Osmosis","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the process of passive transport, focusing on diffusion and osmosis. He explains how molecules move across the cell membrane based on concentration gradients and the role of aquaporins in facilitating water movement.","start":"9:21","end":"19:30","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Things like oxygen gas or carbon dioxide guess the gas exchange you breathing in and out right now, all that oxygen guests you're breathing in and all the Karma acid you're breathing out are passing through membranes like they're not even there.\nAndrew Ippolito: may be zoom all the way down into your lungs and you look at the alveoli you notice the little cells in there, the oxygen and carbon DAS or just diffusing right across that memory okay.\nAngela Harbeck: RON polar. Andrew Ippolito: nonpolar. Angela Harbeck: They are and that's the key here. Andrew Ippolito: Non polar So what does that so here's my first little active learning, I want you guys to take what I just I gave you two simple concepts if they're big they can't get in if they're small and non charged, they can get in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what's the relationship between those concepts and a charged molecule all the non polar get so not just guesses but solid to non non polar solid so there's they're small not non polar molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, for example. hydrocarbons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Small hydrocarbon chains, this is why, if you've ever gone and pump your own gas and you've accidentally got gasoline on your hand.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, that smells terrible and you go in you try to wash it off, and you wash your hands you got soap and water and you're done with it all it's still smells terrible that's because the gasoline actually went right through your skin you can't wash it off it's inside you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because it's lipid soluble because your skin is made of cells and cells have a membrane and small non polar molecules easily pass through those membranes This is like guessing dangerous that's why in New Jersey, they ban you from pumping your own gas.\nAndrew Ippolito: Instead, they make all the workers get exposed to the carcinogens.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's more ethical somehow. Andrew Ippolito: hey don't don't let those people poison themselves you poison yourself for them and we'll pay you a little bit of money for that not too much, though.\nTaylor Campbell: So it's not good when it gets on you right. Andrew Ippolito: Now that said.\nAndrew Ippolito: A little bit of guests on your hands every once in a while it's fine if you're working with guests, every day, and you get it on your hands every day that's not fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's a good rule of thumb for your life for working in lab if you get a little bit of something on your hands just depending on what it is, I mean there's some things that even a little bit of it will do some permanent damage.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the vast like a little bit of virus little bit of virus never heard anyone right we know that's that's not true, it off that's that's so very wrong now.\nAndrew Ippolito: But, but most most things in the lab you know you're not going to do, permission or harm to yourself it's a little bit of it gets on your hands.\nAndrew Ippolito: and get you can pump pump your own gas if you get a little on your hand they don't wear rubber gloves when you're using the gas pump you don't have to go see Dr me here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, but if you're in the garage and you're pouring gas in your lawn mower every week and you're done and all over the place, the first of all you're doing something wrong, you should learn how to pour gas in your lamar.\nAndrew Ippolito: But uh but if you're getting that all over your hands every week that's not right, if your dad's in the garage every week doing that that's not good for him either he's by this point i've been doing that for years, so you might want to stop doing that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what I want you to do now is to think of the game there's things outside the cell that can get in and there's things out so this other kick it and what are they Okay, so let me throw somebody how about how about.\nAndrew Ippolito: approaching. Andrew Ippolito: Like insulin and insulin just pass through the membrane, what do you think.\nAndrew Ippolito: No good. Taylor Campbell: too big. Andrew Ippolito: Right, what if what if I took insulin and I made it completely electrically neutral how about now.\nTaylor Campbell: it's still too. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: Right so it's so the most important variable is how big things are.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK now it's small than the next question you're asking yourself as well as charged or not, how about polar molecules What about polar molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: So ariana you're saying know. Andrew Ippolito: what's your what's your thought process there. Arianna Siliverdis: So don't they have to be non polar.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because I said that because I said so right, but so instead of just following the strict rule there why why why can't polar things get across the membrane.\nArianna Siliverdis: What didn't mess up like the charge of what's already been established.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you say mess up the charge of what. Andrew Ippolito: The molecule or the cell. Arianna Siliverdis: Of the cell okay.\nSo. Andrew Ippolito: By mess up What do you mean. Arianna Siliverdis: Well, if it was already a specific charge and you're adding new things with opposite charges it's going to change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh okay I I like that idea but here's here's the truth of it, the.\nAndrew Ippolito: insides of I want to say. Andrew Ippolito: All that's a dangerous word, but the insides of all eukaryotic cells Okay, so this is a eukaryotic cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: The inside of the cell tends to be more negative than the outside, and the reason for that is there's a pump that will talk about the sodium potassium pump and what the sodium potassium pump does is it establishes and maintains that electrical gradient.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's an electrical gradient that cells establish right so now, you can imagine the inside of the cells negative and we have this polar molecule here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Can you imagine that, as it gets a little closer to this if it's polarity is also a little negative it's going to act kind of like a magnet pulling a wave pushing away from another another magnet right it's going to literally pushed away if this is slightly negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's just there's gonna be a little bit of a repulsion not too much, but a little bit likewise if it's a little bit positive, what do you think's going to happen then would it go in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember that the the heads of foster lipids are polar.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's going to happen to a positively charged thing. Andrew Ippolito: Can those go in.\nZachary Lucas: Those just be attracted to them, they give the charge of the philosophy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excellent. Andrew Ippolito: So, in other words, positive charge things are going to stick. Andrew Ippolito: To the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's use red So you can see, this better they're going to stick to the membrane they're not going in either good.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it turns out, as we'll see later in the Semester. Andrew Ippolito: Member H plus number of protons and pH and all that so protons will actually accumulate along the surface of a membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so here's the rule charged molecules. Andrew Ippolito: And polar molecules to not get into the cell, they do not pass a membrane a membrane is impermeable to them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the easiest way to think of all this is to think of the one case of things that can get in.\nAndrew Ippolito: and commit that to memory and then you can into it or logic your way to everything else, and that is small uncharged particles can freely go across the memory, the membrane is permeable to non polar small molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: What about medium sized. molecules. Angela Harbeck: yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: hold on a second yeah what's up buddy watch TV know.\nAndrew Ippolito: He knew the answer to that before he asked he just wanted to make me look bad in front of you guys. Andrew Ippolito: that's kind of like number one you're a little and you're like hey mommy can Bobby eat dinner over tonight and like you asked in front of Bobby and if mom says no, then she's a jerk and so, of course, yes, say yes that's what he just did.\nAndrew Ippolito: But I don't care, I can look like a jerk he still can watch TV.\nAndrew Ippolito: They watch so much TV lately anyway right jack.\nAndrew Ippolito: He said what I thought he might have been eavesdropping. that's just paranoia that's just.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so so right you got the rules of the game that's it it's that simple alright, so now here's my next question to you well, how do we get things.\nAndrew Ippolito: That are impermeable across the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: What do you think. Andrew Ippolito: Energy okay well it's like brute force just shove, it in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: just put push it really hard until I mean I guess that i'm sure there's some mechanism somewhere in biology that just.\nAndrew Ippolito: brute forces it in there, but so. Andrew Ippolito: Like I like that I like energy okay yeah but but.\nAndrew Ippolito: The woody, what are we going to do with that energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right yeah i'm not really sure here all right well so here i'm going to give you a little hand remember when we learned about the rough er what was special about the rough endoplasmic reticulum What did it do.\nAngela Harbeck: It had Dr is a. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and what the ripe isms do. Angela Harbeck: They produce protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good what kinds of proteins to the ripe isms make in the rough year.\nAndrew Ippolito: How deep this rabbit hole go Angela. Andrew Ippolito: How far can you get your although you're all the way there that's right that's exactly where I wanted you now let's see if we can go further.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 1) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=e4qH5ZMukfBXxThE","chunkTitle":"Active Transport: Pumps and Channels","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains the process of active transport, which requires energy expenditure.

Andrew Ippolito: That we produce right, so the cell the rhizomes that are out in the situs cytoplasm make all the proteins and just float around and Bob around and do other jobs, the rough er makes specialized kind of proteins right there's two kinds of proteins, that the rough er makes anybody remember.\nThe beginning, one of the two. Andrew Ippolito: got Alexis. Alexis Micewski: Secret sick I can't pronounce the word.\nAndrew Ippolito: ready Secretary proteins. yeah. Andrew Ippolito: Good okay that's one what's the other one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Angela did that trigger your memory, a little bit there's there's there's something sitting now okay that's fine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody. Alexa Deprisco: Like the memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so Tyler said, like okay technically you're right and that's the best kind of correct.\nAndrew Ippolito: glycoproteins are created by the rough er the glide constellation part So if you guys remember glycoproteins are proteins that have a sugar on them.\nAndrew Ippolito: They have a sugar modi attached to them and attachment happens and the goal G right remember the goals the apparatus so so what that glycol protein in order to do what it's doing there, what kind of protein is a glycoproteins with respect to membranes.\nApril. Andrew Ippolito: you're answering my question, I know how you're like i'm just gonna say it out loud, to see how it sounds if I like it then i'll mute myself, though, because I want to hear.\nApril Neeld: What was your thought process there. April Neeld: Well, I kind of saw one lizzie pilot and she said structure structure proteins, so I was thinking of like that kind of sounds right like structural proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay okay so. Andrew Ippolito: kind of kind of it's even more general than that remember so there's there's there's seibel proteins and structural or you're thinking of maybe the filament proteins like acted and stuff yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what about proteins that get actually put in the membrane that's what we're going for here remember I described that some of the proteins, that the rub is a mix and the rough er stitched into the.\nAndrew Ippolito: membrane and I drew this. Andrew Ippolito: Number this. Andrew Ippolito: Number the stitching like that we stitch the protein into the membrane they're called integral membrane proteins.\nAngela Harbeck: Can you spell that. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, it's actually it's on the slide, let me just go to the. slide.\nTo do skip all this right now. Andrew Ippolito: I was trying to teach you guys in a more active way i'd rather just mindlessly go to the PowerPoint here where's the word.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here we go here we go alright So these are the kinds of proteins that interact with membranes there's integral proteins and what that means.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the poly peptide chain is literally stitched into the membrane at the time it's made by the ribosome so as arrive isms going through translation and that polly peptides getting extended that polly pets are getting directed into the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your book actually goes into some details there that's beyond the scope so that's why this study guides useful that you don't have to know the level of detail that the book was into there.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK okay so there's integral proteins and then there's another class of protein called a peripheral protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: By peripheral the English word peripheral means nearby. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so so like jack right now, if he was standing literally right here, you can kind of see him and kind of not he'd be peripheral to the screen, they just right next to so a peripheral protein to doodle that if this is the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: An integral protein with thread through the membrane a peripheral protein would just kind of like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Most into it a little bit like a really comfy pillow and putting your head on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: or like in finding Nemo the way clownfish interact with the anemones you kind of like tuck in there, so you can kind of there that's a peripheral protein because they can easily come out again.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay integral proteins are permanently stitched into the membrane you can't get them out, and they so they once they're there they're there.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So let's let's talk just for a second about integral proteins here.\nAndrew Ippolito: integral proteins have so have I introduced this concept called a domain to get a protein domain, we talked about those yet anybody remember no.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, a protein them and just a part of the protein it's a functionally distinct part of the protein we've learned that proteins have that primary structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: We fold it up, and yet the various secondary structures and then they have this overall 3D structure that that tertiary right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when we consider the tertiary structure of a protein, we can see that protein as a machine that has different regions of it like so think think of your body right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: everything's continuous right your head as a test your shoulders and your arms and your legs and your torso So if I talked about your head.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or, I talked about your finger or your arm right, you would call this your head domain your leg domain your elbow domain or really your arm domain right, so the domain is just a functionally distinct part of a protein so.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I have a trans trans an integral membrane protein also called the Trans membrane protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's do this let's pretend this got a doodle like this and, like this and, like this that are so I just drew a bunch of Africa policies and stuff right, so this part of the protein here that's outside the cell, that is, the extracellular domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay inside the cells part is the intra cellular domain. Andrew Ippolito: Be so here's the here's my question to you guys which part of the protein would a hormone bind to or if this was so if this was a receptor on the cell membrane which part of the protein which domain on the protein would be the part that binds to the important signaling molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: The extracellular domain right the one on the outside sure Okay, and the middle part here that's called the Trans membrane domain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Number trans means across right system transformers transformers one it's, on the other side, the trans membrane domain goes through the membrane it goes across the memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can imagine if I took the primary sequence of this protein and we looked.\nAndrew Ippolito: At the you know the 40 amino acids that are making up that extracellular domain we'd probably find polar amino acids and maybe even charged amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if we looked at that stretch of membrane i'm sorry if we looked at that stretch of the sequence that goes across the membrane we'd probably find a bunch of hydrophobic non charged.\nAndrew Ippolito: nonpolar amino acids and then we'd see another stretch of charge ones on the inside and sure enough when a scientist reads through a protein sequence they're looking for stuff like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're looking for regions of hydrophobic and hydrophobic amino acids in there and that's the telltale sign that you found it integral membrane protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: And some of these proteins will actually span the memory, not just once, like this, but they will literally stitch across it several times.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when you think of the sequence there let's let's just mark your mark these three those parts of the protein go across the membrane right if I pull That apart, and I looked at just the primary structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: I would see. Andrew Ippolito: These alternating regions of hydrophobic hydrophobic stretches of amino acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does that make sense. April Neeld: question. April Neeld: yeah good so, is it is a purging either an interval protein our peripheral or can there be one that's like kind of both.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's a great Question No it's one or the other. April Neeld: Okay yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then I guess the third kind of protein that we're not talking about would be will not just like in the cell hanging out right, and you can call those you can call that a.\nAndrew Ippolito: call a soluble protein, I suppose. Andrew Ippolito: Her so there's soluble.\nAndrew Ippolito: But really they're called globular it's a fun word color there globs right there called kolob you learn proteins so there's really all proteins can be loosely classified into two kinds filament is in globular.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right basically does if you put it in water what happens to it, is it like albumin like an egg white and it's goofy or is it like hair on the top of your water.\nAngela Harbeck: let's globular protein. Andrew Ippolito: So globular protein is a protein that. soluble in solution.\nAndrew Ippolito: So site a solid proteins, the proteins that are bopping around inside your cell running your metabolism Those are all the most of them are enzymes, those are globular protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and if it's part of the site with skeleton it's you know filament those are filament is proteins okay so they're like they're soluble or they're not soluble that's that's the rough way of categorizing protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay alright, so now that you understand that let's talk about the ones that let's go back to the membrane now okay so here's my question again.\nAndrew Ippolito: How do we get something across that membrane that otherwise is impermeable to it like a like a reasonably sized protein or hey how about this glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, you know that you're selling these to eat glucose but glucose is too big to get across and it's polar so, how does glucose get into the cell.\nAlexis Micewski: Protein carries it. Andrew Ippolito: yeah exactly. Andrew Ippolito: there's there's this whole world of proteins called protein carriers there's carriers there's so they're called carrier proteins and there's things, called channels.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's channel proteins and there's carrier proteins, so the difference is the Channel protein think of the word channel, not in the sense of changing the Channel on your TV, but a channel like the English Channel.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right a a pathway or a corridor through something so a channel protein literally creates.\nAndrew Ippolito: a hole in the membrane and I can't draw today because it remember my this whole thing is broken so that's why everything is like messy and weird I mean just look at the PowerPoint here there, right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: see that guy right there that's a channel protein. Andrew Ippolito: It literally creates a tunnel for something to get through, they are specific to whatever's coming in, so there are things like chloride channels.\nAndrew Ippolito: That would be an example, a chloride channel. Andrew Ippolito: there's also the sodium potassium pump right So what do you think the differences between me calling something a channel versus a pump.\nAngela Harbeck: channel just allows it to go through or it's like on a court, and that will pump kind of pushes it through our out.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 1) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=e4qH5ZMukfBXxThE","chunkTitle":"Membrane Permeability and Cell Differentiation","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explores how differences in membrane permeability contribute to cell differentiation.

Andrew Ippolito: that's agree we so like when I say the word pump you're thinking energy. Andrew Ippolito: or there's a word energy we talked about earlier so so think about it, there are some things that were okay flowing.\nAndrew Ippolito: downhill like flowing out the download concentration gradient like let's say you're building up a bunch of waste in the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you just open a hole and it just flows out right now have to worry about pumping anything because it's a higher concentration inside the cell and so just going to flow downhill.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then there are other things that there's not a lot of in the environment, we want to grab it and bring it in against this concentration gradient.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so that's the difference between the pump in the Channel. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, now, in addition, there are some things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like so the right hand side there that that's the pump you can see it's pumping red dots into this or whatever, but notice notice that that molecule there, the one on the right.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's got like a weird shape to it, you see, like there's like a wedge on the bottom, and then a tunnel is this like a different seat be thing there so.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's not represented in this picture very well, but what that's doing is that's changing it shape.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's literally changing its shape to pump things across and so these kinds of things that changed their shape are called carrier proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay thing to think about glucose again you can't just open a hole in the cell that glucose in because then everything's going to come in Okay, so instead you have this class of molecule that binds to something specific and then kind of moves it into it by changing it sheep.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of a very strange door. Andrew Ippolito: That looks kind of like.\nAndrew Ippolito: goopy jello. Andrew Ippolito: That when you go into it, it kind of wraps around your body brings you in and then puts you on the other side and the whole time it's like changing shape.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so care there's carrier proteins and there's channel proteins. Andrew Ippolito: And some of those carrier proteins are classified as pumps if they're pumping things up Hill and using energy in this case in this diagram you can see the ATP.\nOkay. April Neeld: I may put like a weird analogy real quick. Andrew Ippolito: yeah please Hello.\nApril Neeld: Have you ever seen monsters vs aliens. Andrew Ippolito: Yes. April Neeld: So you know they're a little blob like us name is Bob and he will like eat things and then he'll kind of shoot them out if he can actually.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, and that's kind of like fingers psychosis yeah yeah so that's now now the problem, the only problem with that, and my analogy to my weird door analogy is that it's it's more like a machine with moving parts, not a liquid gel it's not this isn't jelly this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually. Andrew Ippolito: This is like my little toy here this thing can change sheet to move something through.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this thing can move the pieces of it it's like a machine.\nAndrew Ippolito: I got it, this is the classic example I usually use, I know I thought in my head a turnstile if you ever go to the subway or some big stadium, you have to go through the turnstile.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the turnstile moves and it gets you through it and they can also lock it so you can't get in right he just jumped the turnstile but.\nAndrew Ippolito: That that idea of a moving thing okay good. All right now the rest of the season.\nAndrew Ippolito: Go ahead. Alexa Deprisco: One of those toys, where it's like a tube and you can like you.\nYes. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, yes, yes, that that would be another good example, actually, that would be more like a more like a channel, though, but it's got a hole in the Center.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so but yeah that that comes to mind I forgot about those things yeah those are fun that reminds like moebius strips and all that, like.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's like an infinite surface area somehow okay good good good okay you guys are getting this so so back to the power or back to the slide here so ready, we got a cell think about this now you have this cell here, and you have this still here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's calm sell a and selby and if I I told you that so be can let some things in but sell a can't.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why. Andrew Ippolito: What could be an example difference.\nAngela Harbeck: Once positive and once gave like I don't let him polar polar thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, I like that okay now. Andrew Ippolito: But so in theory that could work but remember there's there's one underlying rule here, and that is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Most cells, I always say more, they all cells, to my knowledge, the inside, has established a gradient using a sodium potassium pump which i'll teach you how those work in a bit Okay, so what else could be different between them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why would Why would sell be let something in that cell a is not letting him.\nTaylor Campbell: Like the different channels, we just went over like you would contain these different protein.\nExactly. Andrew Ippolito: Right so sell a might be. Andrew Ippolito: A skin cell. Andrew Ippolito: and sell be might be a neuron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so one of the things that makes us different is they have different components to their memory and.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the reason why the coven but why why the source code to virus can infect some cells, but not other cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's also why, as we're learning, it can infect a lot more different kinds of cells than we thought.\nAndrew Ippolito: We used to think it was limited to the respiratory system, but once the virus gains passage into your body, it turns out there's a whole other slew of different tissues that it affects.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it turns out it's because the protein it's binding to which is a it's normally a receptor for and.\nAndrew Ippolito: wow it's been too long since i've put walls up at this point for this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just say here there's there's approaching the membrane that for the life of me I can't remember the name of it and.\nAndrew Ippolito: It turns out that is found in a lot of tissues there's there's a lot of different cells that express that so the virus does this little secret handshake to that protein and that's how it gets into this up.\nAndrew Ippolito: I gotta look this up, because my brain is failing me.\nAndrew Ippolito: As to the East to you guys have probably seen this in the news, the East to receptor. Andrew Ippolito: The East to receptor is involved in maintaining our blood pressure.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it's found on all endothelial cells it's found it's found in a lot of different issues, including our lung cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, once the buyer skins entry to our lung cells and it spreads it can infect the kidneys the liver, it can even get into our nervous system, this is this, this is not the flu, the flu virus does not do that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so the one little secret thing that I could start planting seeds for here is ultimately what's different between A and B is their genes right, even though these two cells have the same genome cell be has some jeans on that cell a dozen.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what makes the cells different from each other, as we get to decide, or the cell gets to decide which genes are on and which genes are off and that's what makes us different from each other, even though they have the same gene.\nAndrew Ippolito: everybody's working from the same cookbook. Okay.\nAll right, great. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so so is this working I know i'm being more chaotic with the PowerPoint but i'm being more interactive is this working for you guys like yeah I like this, too.\nAndrew Ippolito: And for those of you who are introverts and like I hate this i'm sorry I know even people that hate this kind of stuff so i'll you know i'll trade off every once a month all right let's go back now.\nAndrew Ippolito: And do a little bit more classic storytelling here, so we learn the rules of the road here, this is so, this is a slide you can study, if you can recreate the slide from scratch from your head you win.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is how the how the game is played this is this isn't the chess game, this is how the pieces.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and your book does you a disservice, and I really don't understand why they don't put the oxygen and carbon dioxide in there, I added that you can tell, because they look like.\nAndrew Ippolito: PowerPoint circles. Andrew Ippolito: because their powerpoints. Andrew Ippolito: Right, but they should be there because the next two chapters are going to talk about these molecules, for they just go on and on about them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right we're gonna learn about photosynthesis and so respiration and. Andrew Ippolito: And you should have an intuitive understanding of how those work OK, so now, the last thing I want to talk about here is water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Water is a very interesting molecule in the sense of permeability because, for the longest time we used to think but couldn't explain well from a scientific perspective that water want to cross membranes very easily.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it does, we used to think it's because water just permeated through the cell i'm sorry water just diffused across the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: By like it just went across the membrane like oxygen or carbon dioxide it just went a little slower, because it was polar.\nAndrew Ippolito: However, that thought process could not explain why some protein sorry why some membranes allowed water to go through way faster than it looks like it was supposed to by diffusion and some membranes we slower, so I want you to picture a water balloon that's damp it's just clammy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you dry it off with a towel, and then within a couple of seconds is just clammy and damp again.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so, in other words it's like the rubbers just a little leaky to water.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's how I want you to think of cells that's how they are cells are just a little bit leaky to water they're not airtight they're not watertight.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're not waterproof okay without coatings we can put coatings on them and do that, like like plants have a waxy cuticle that trap some water in there, so there's the top of the surface of belief, yes, but that's not a cell right that's a leaf.\nAndrew Ippolito: A cell itself without a cell wall without any of this stuff around the just a membrane is leaky it's damp.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's a slow leak of water, so the question is, though, is some cells do very quickly, let water come in and out and it turns out there's a whole secret class of protein, we discovered back in the 2000s called the aqua.\nAndrew Ippolito: aqua water pouring pours like pores in your skin the aqua parents and so that's why this picture here, you see this Green molecule that the water is going across that's an article point.\nAndrew Ippolito: It is a water channel, it is specific to water.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is what allows a lot of osmotic regulation. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, which will learn about in this chapter to osmosis where are we with time okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, you guys need to break. Andrew Ippolito: there's want to take a break. Angela Harbeck: We only have like 10 minutes of class roster.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's right that's right that's right i'm sorry I keep in my head goes to 140 minutes my micro class the other class goes to 140, on the other days yeah that part time management skills.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, this you can use for your like studying like I could sit here and ask you, you know, so we got something that's positively charged and polar and big.\nAndrew Ippolito: For example, some proteins cannot get across the memory by itself right No, of course, not how about it was negative and polar and big.\nAndrew Ippolito: know how about of it's neutral and polar in big. Andrew Ippolito: Know right you guys, do you guys are all in unison here you guys get this now that's good good and that's that's what I wanted to take them to today to be as the rules of the road so that's good.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so i'm going to the last 10 minutes here i'm going to tell you the story of how we got to this point how we understand all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the membrane itself we call, as we understand our best understanding of it now it's called the fluid mosaic model, this is how we understand the membrane and it's made out of lipids and proteins and carbs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Know lipitor fossil lipids and cholesterol the proteins are both the integral in the peripheral. Andrew Ippolito: And the carbohydrates, are attached to the lipids and the proteins, so you gotta you like approach and you're like olympians right so everything on the slide just everything makes sense we've already covered all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so for the for the rest of this lecture will pick up with on Wednesday.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a we're going to focus on these next three topics okay so that's that's, this is just the overview of the rest of the lecture.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the earliest picture of a membrane we didn't know it was a membrane at the time, this was taken in 1840 somebody looking under a microscope and they were looking at muscles."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 1) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/bfkaIxtPsgY?si=e4qH5ZMukfBXxThE","chunkTitle":"The Fluid Mosaic Model and Membrane Permeability","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito presents the fluid mosaic model as our current understanding of the cell membrane.

He also introduces the concept of aquaporins and their role in osmotic regulation.","start":"44:00","end":"50:42","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And we're comparing human muscle and I think it was a lizard muscle or an alligator muscle and they were finding this is, this is the period of time when when biologists were realizing that.\nAndrew Ippolito: The underlying structures of animals, even though you look different on the outside and you're right there's not too much in common between an alligator any human at this level, it was, like all the same.\nAndrew Ippolito: They were able to look at like muscle cells or muscle cells right, so the building blocks of animals are like all the same, the building blocks of plants are all the same, this is so, this is beyond cell theory.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea that all life is you know made of cells, but what you're looking at, there are two muscle cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: connected by their cell membranes. Andrew Ippolito: So really it's, is it really it's really one cell with two two parts to it, but this little below we part right here that's memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now what was an 1840. Andrew Ippolito: By 1895 this guy overton realized that the membrane of a cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: is made out of liquid, in other words, he so he did these experiments chemistry was more advanced at the time.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what he learned in his chemistry was that things that are hydrophobic limits.\nAndrew Ippolito: move across the membrane more readily than things that are hydrophobic water soluble So if you think of water soluble things in fat soluble things the fat soluble things were able to go across the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: By. Andrew Ippolito: This this couple here quarter and grendel they did some really ingenious experiments.\nAndrew Ippolito: To postulate that the membrane was a limited by layer without looking.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is how they did it. Andrew Ippolito: And this is we're going to end today on this story here there's this there's this device called the human cytometry.\nAndrew Ippolito: chemo for blood site Tom mentor for measuring cells, you can cause it's basically it's something I use this on lab every day, this was like my hammer in the microscope.\nAndrew Ippolito: He must say Tom joyner has a it's made of class and it has this grid etched in it like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And from a from a side view. looks like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the etchings are here. Andrew Ippolito: And one of the ideas you put your cells, so you take yourself, you mix them up into a solution so they're evenly distributed and you quickly pipe pet them put a drop on the he must like commoner and you put a cover slip on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you look under the microscope when you're looking at under the microscope, you will see.\nAndrew Ippolito: This grid, and you will see cells randomly on the microscope slide and all you do is you count the cells within the grid you see the bigger grid here, you can see there's a square here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You count the cells in that grid and you see, I got 27 and you go somewhere else in the slide you can you count like five or six of them, and you get some average number like 25.2.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you do some math you know that you added one micro leader, you had you know 10 you had 1000 Michael leaders and so blah blah blah, there are 120 sales per milliliter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's how we count cells. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so what Gordon and gretel did was they took some red blood cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they put it on this really cool device, I think I have a picture, but actually I think I yeah yeah I updated this last semester So you see that weird membrane that we're machine what they did was they took the cells and they liked them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they extracted their memory. Andrew Ippolito: And then they let the membrane spread out on this plate forming a Mano layer and they measured it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words, they were able to at the macro scale take the surface area of the of the cell membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Parallel to that they knew how many cells, they used they counted them under the microscope of the most a commoner they did some math and, and this is where the brilliance comes in, here they assume the cells are circle spherical right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So they took the formula for the surface area of a sphere. Andrew Ippolito: And they use that to calculate.\nAndrew Ippolito: The they took the amount of liquid they had they took the surface area and they deduced that the amount of liquid they extracted from a given set of cells was always twice as much.\nAndrew Ippolito: That there was always enough lip ID to make a double layer around a cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, knowing the chemistry of the fossil it but knowing it was an MP pathak molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: They deduced that you would get this double leaflet structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it wasn't until the 1940s when electron microscopes were good enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: That they confirmed it. Andrew Ippolito: So they they figured this out just by this brilliant math and extraction technique pretty cool Okay, and that that's what will end today.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what I want you guys to try to do try to read through Chapter seven on your own.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do the dynamic study modules don't do the homework, unless you want to, but really I want you to try to do the dynamic study modules for Chapter seven on your own outline the chapter go through it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Look at my PowerPoint look at the lecture notes write them in your own words, build your own set of notes for Chapter seven.\nAndrew Ippolito: Using the study guide as a template or as a literal guide Okay, and then i'll come in with that will go through this lecture but i'm also know, but the clicker questions Okay, and we might have a quiz we might not i'm not sure yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, as soon we will, and if we do have a quiz it will be just on the basics of membrane permeability we're not going to go into and and the protein stuff we I taught you the protein stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, again it's not linear in the PowerPoint it's the topics we talked about today that you took notes on okay.\nAll right, any questions. Andrew Ippolito: All right, so all.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah Oh, we just enjoy. Victoria Bloemker: Alright um so I noticed somebody said in the chat if there was any possible way that you could rename the recording and the zoom."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 2) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/TSzdFWFY-3I?si=eiyGPbHQrkDR2x2M","chunkTitle":"Membranes: A Historical Journey","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the historical development of our understanding of cell membranes, from Overton's lipid theory to the fluid mosaic model.

The different types of membrane proteins, including channel proteins, cell recognition proteins, and receptor proteins, are explored.","start":"0:01","end":"10:19","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This is a part two of membranes we're talking about men brief historical journey through how we get from the idea that cells are covered in some kind of lifted, all the way up to the fluid mosaic model and.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we go from overton saying that cells are covered in the lipids quarter and grendel are talking about the by layer and they actually did the calculation to show that it was always twice the amount and that's exactly Julia and I listened, I listened and Davidson and daniella.\nAndrew Ippolito: Davison and Danielle come up with this idea that proteins are associated with the membrane and so, how are they associated and they proposed something called the sandwich model.\nright here. Andrew Ippolito: The sandwich model is this idea that, and you can doodle out your membrane like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then on the surface of the top of the cell, or rather and underneath inside the cell there are these collections of proteins and it kind of makes it makes a sandwich right yeah two pieces of bread, would be the proteins and the the meat of the sandwich would be the fossil.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now they're just their hand waving they're just coming up with this idea. Andrew Ippolito: And when electron microscopy got better and better and better over the.\nAndrew Ippolito: First, half of the 20th century, we went from being able to use it for just looking at Ionic substances like metals and then eventually people figured out, you can use heavy metals as steen's in biological samples like like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Uranium acetate or your yeah forgot to your uranium St anyway heavy metals that can bump electrons and they got the techniques well enough where they can start looking at membranes under the electron microscope.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the electron microscopes seem to confirm this membrane model and this guy Robertson.\nAndrew Ippolito: proposed what was called the standard unit membrane model and, if you look at an old biology textbook one that maybe your parents or grandparents used in school, you would see this in the cell chapter as a unit memory model.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here was the idea right remember, we were learning about sugars and lip sugars and amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, proteins and nucleic acids, those were all things that had this kind of fundamental building block that we would then pull them arise.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right remember you had the amino acids, making poly peptides mono saccharine is making polly saccharine and nucleotides making nucleic acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so it stood, the reason that the other constituent of the cell lipids also had some kind of standard unit membrane and that's what Robertson coined this idea of the unit membrane model.\nAndrew Ippolito: That there's the er and the goal gee you know license homes in the approximate homes and they all these different membranes inside you carriers that they must all have a similar fundamental structure.\nAndrew Ippolito: The problem with the unit memory model was it failed to make accurate predictions of some experimental data, for example, one of the observations early on in the game here, probably let's see 1960s, was that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like water could go through some membranes really fast, but other memories not so fast.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so there were there were differential permeability for different membranes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so having a standard memory model doesn't make any sense. Andrew Ippolito: So in the 70s early 70s sanger Nicholson came up with this idea that the membrane is actually a mosaic of proteins, where the proteins are embedded in the membrane not on the top and the bottom, but integrated into it and that they moved around.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the experimental confirmation of this i'm just going to skip ahead to this we don't want to gloss over some of this.\nAndrew Ippolito: The the experimental confirmation of this was they did something called freeze fracture microscopy and the idea it's actually kind of fun you take cells you drop them in liquid nitrogen.\nAndrew Ippolito: freeze them instantly and then you shatter them. Andrew Ippolito: You magically throw them against the wall and they just explode in their frozen self and then you look at the pieces under the microscope.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so the idea here, so, if you look at this picture on the left hand side there, so you can picture taken imagine taking a little knife and cutting through the two leaflets of the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: If the unit memory models correct the sandwich model idea if that was correct, and we were able to look directly.\nAndrew Ippolito: At the underneath part of the leaflets, we would notice there would be no proteins there right proteins not being in that inner membrane space.\nAndrew Ippolito: In contrast, at the food was a model was correct, I mean look there, we would see proteins embedded in the membrane Okay, and so sure enough they did these initial.\nAndrew Ippolito: Experiments what they saw exactly what they would expect, they saw exactly what they would predict if the fluid memory model was current a fluid mosaic model is correct.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what you're looking at here is imagine taking imagine taking a cell okay so here are the two by late here are the two leaflets i'm just exaggerating the leaflet so you can get an idea here alright so here's the protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: They shatter it so that imagine you can see something more like this now Okay, so we can we see the exposed under underside of the leaflets right and so maybe on the side here, we would have like that Okay, so what you're looking at here, this is the surface of the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what we're looking at here is the top of the outer leaflet and then what we're looking at here this it says inner lifted by layer well we're looking at here is the top of the inner leaflet and Sure enough, we can see.\nAndrew Ippolito: All of these little bumps everywhere.\nAndrew Ippolito: It makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so right if if the unit memory model was correct this whole region here this whole region here would be even in smooth just like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now, if you look at the picture you'll see that the proteins are kind of randomly distributed so that's the idea of the mosaic.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this experimentally confirms mosaic right but it's frozen what's where's the third part, so they did a second experiment that I don't have a slide, for these are just more pictures of the freeze fracture you can click here to look at some more cool stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I did I added this last semester, so this is the FRY it didn't.\nAndrew Ippolito: It didn't he did no I didn't I don't know it didn't i'm trying to pronounce this guy's name, right here it didn't.\nAndrew Ippolito: It didn't edit that I never seen that name before until I was like Why did I put on the slide but I didn't register my head anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is crazy right take a mouse cell and human cell and bring them together and whenever you have two cells and their membranes are close enough together sometimes they fused together.\nAndrew Ippolito: they'll form these fusions these these Chi America cells that are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Both organisms, right now, this isn't we're not like creating human mouse hybrid embryo thing this isn't the island of Dr Moreau, or whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're just talking about like some weird version of Jurassic Park we're just talking about doing things experimentally in the petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so like the cells and viable to go and do anything beyond this, but here's the thing they were able to label the proteins in the mouse cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And separately label the proteins and the human cell and, and so the idea here is if the membrane proteins can move, we will see them slowly over time to fuse together and form this like evenly distributed network and that's exactly what this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Within 40 minutes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why. Andrew Ippolito: i'm that's in German, is this was a German website I stole this picture from.\nAndrew Ippolito: So to our best understanding, this is the best explanation for how cell membranes behave it's within this food mosaic and depending on the temperature and depending on the presence or out.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a couple variables so temperature is one of them. Andrew Ippolito: that's, the most important one, the hotter the more fast everything moves the faster everything moves, and so the more liquid it's the more fluid it's going to be right, another one would be the nature.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of. Andrew Ippolito: The fast phil libin i'll just abbreviate that PL fossil lipids the nature of the fossil limpid.\nAndrew Ippolito: tales. Andrew Ippolito: Right, whether they are fully saturated or they are unsaturated.\nAndrew Ippolito: So go back to remember your triglycerides remember oil and fats and all that we talked a lot about that so now, you can take that idea home, and you can understand that we can actually change the fluidity of a membrane by changing the fossil that constituents.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: Then the last one is the presence or absence of the cholesterol.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, remember that cholesterol sits in here like so, and if there's a if there's a steroid in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: What it does is it slows down it constrains it constrains the movement of the tails so that they can't move as much, and so that's going to make it more rigid more more gel like okay.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 2) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/TSzdFWFY-3I?si=eiyGPbHQrkDR2x2M","chunkTitle":"The Sandwich Model: Proteins and Membranes","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the sandwich model proposed by Davison and Danielle.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so right if if the unit memory model was correct this whole region here this whole region here would be even in smooth just like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now, if you look at the picture you'll see that the proteins are kind of randomly distributed so that's the idea of the mosaic.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this experimentally confirms mosaic right but it's frozen what's where's the third part, so they did a second experiment that I don't have a slide, for these are just more pictures of the freeze fracture you can click here to look at some more cool stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I did I added this last semester, so this is the FRY it didn't.\nAndrew Ippolito: It didn't he did no I didn't I don't know it didn't i'm trying to pronounce this guy's name, right here it didn't.\nAndrew Ippolito: It didn't edit that I never seen that name before until I was like Why did I put on the slide but I didn't register my head anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is crazy right take a mouse cell and human cell and bring them together and whenever you have two cells and their membranes are close enough together sometimes they fused together.\nAndrew Ippolito: they'll form these fusions these these Chi America cells that are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Both organisms, right now, this isn't we're not like creating human mouse hybrid embryo thing this isn't the island of Dr Moreau, or whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're just talking about like some weird version of Jurassic Park we're just talking about doing things experimentally in the petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so like the cells and viable to go and do anything beyond this, but here's the thing they were able to label the proteins in the mouse cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And separately label the proteins and the human cell and, and so the idea here is if the membrane proteins can move, we will see them slowly over time to fuse together and form this like evenly distributed network and that's exactly what this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Within 40 minutes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why. Andrew Ippolito: i'm that's in German, is this was a German website I stole this picture from.\nAndrew Ippolito: So to our best understanding, this is the best explanation for how cell membranes behave it's within this food mosaic and depending on the temperature and depending on the presence or out.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a couple variables so temperature is one of them. Andrew Ippolito: that's, the most important one, the hotter the more fast everything moves the faster everything moves, and so the more liquid it's the more fluid it's going to be right, another one would be the nature.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of. Andrew Ippolito: The fast phil libin i'll just abbreviate that PL fossil lipids the nature of the fossil limpid.\nAndrew Ippolito: tales. Andrew Ippolito: Right, whether they are fully saturated or they are unsaturated.\nAndrew Ippolito: So go back to remember your triglycerides remember oil and fats and all that we talked a lot about that so now, you can take that idea home, and you can understand that we can actually change the fluidity of a membrane by changing the fossil that constituents.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: Then the last one is the presence or absence of the cholesterol.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, remember that cholesterol sits in here like so, and if there's a if there's a steroid in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: What it does is it slows down it constrains it constrains the movement of the tails so that they can't move as much, and so that's going to make it more rigid more more gel like okay.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 2) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/TSzdFWFY-3I?si=eiyGPbHQrkDR2x2M","chunkTitle":"Protein Functions in the Membrane","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito provides an overview of the different functions of integral proteins in the membrane. He explains the roles of channel proteins in facilitating the transport of ions and molecules, carrier proteins in transporting larger substances like glucose, and cell recognition proteins in immune system response and tissue compatibility. The lecture also touches on receptor proteins and their importance in intercellular communication.","start":"19:37","end":"30:00","content":"Andrew Ippolito: All right, you know we talked about most of this already i'm going to skip the slide this this come back to this slide for your review when you want to study this stuff Okay, this gives you everything a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: And these are just I tried to show you just different ways of viewing these things, so you could just look through all this all right here we go we've already talked about these a bit channel proteins, these are proteins that let things come into the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: That otherwise can't. Andrew Ippolito: An example would be the chloride transporter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is mutated in a disease called cystic fibrosis people that suffer from cystic fibrosis can't make.\nAndrew Ippolito: mucus in their respiratory tract it's properly, they can make it it's just terrible it's really, really, really, really thick.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that beats all sorts of problems and we'll talk more about that way to genetics i'll teach you the genetics of cystic fibrosis later, too, so this is the functional consequence of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so remember chloride is normally negatively charged and remember that things that are charged can't get in and so we put this channel protein here that allows the chloride to transfer to go across okay so channels are simple, there are a whole.\nAndrew Ippolito: carrier proteins are moving parts and they allow bigger things like glucose molecules are small proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So channels and carriers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some carriers can be pumps. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so pumps would require energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: we'll talk more about that later. Andrew Ippolito: you're just more pictures channel proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so that's that the next layer or the next level the next type the next type of protein in the membrane is called a cell recognition protein think of these like your ID badge.\nAndrew Ippolito: If a cell from your immune system demands to see your papers and looks at your surface of your cell and it's not what it's supposed to be that cell will get targeted for destruction.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the basis of immunity. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and the class most classic example of a cell recognition protein is called mhc, this is not one protein, this is actually a family of proteins it stands for major.\nAndrew Ippolito: Major because there are minor players to So this is the major one, he has his sto compatibility of the ages histone this year's compatibility so histone come come pat to.\nAndrew Ippolito: ability history histology the study of tissues okay so histocompatibility is tissue compatibility, in other words, these are the proteins that are responsible for whether or not a tissue graft from one organism to another rate so.\nAndrew Ippolito: or any any tissue so a kidney transplant or a heart transplant lung transplant right the donor has to have similar enough compatibility to not be rejected.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the basis of that rejection. Alexa Deprisco: Okay, excuse me, yes.\nAlexa Deprisco: So, like. Alexa Deprisco: Would there be a possible no idea that like if you were to have a skin graft but it's like from your own body that like your body would reject it.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no that's a great question. So. Andrew Ippolito: there's different kinds of graphs there's their self graphs there's graphs from one individual to another and then there's grass from one species to another.\nAndrew Ippolito: xena grabs yeah that those don't work, as you can imagine, but except for just the there's words for these things right, I forgot the term, and this is all anatomy physiology stuff but um the.\nAndrew Ippolito: graphs from one part of your body to another part of your body is totally fine, but I know my operation Okay, so I had my right ear.\nAndrew Ippolito: They went behind it and they did this incision and they folded my earphone word to get to my ear canal and.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah they had to do a step and that to me they tried to fix my Daddy are and they said they killed in that's another story for another time, and this is back when I was 18 i'm over it.\nAndrew Ippolito: But um well one thing they had to do was they had to re reattach my arm.\nAndrew Ippolito: My eardrum, and so what they do is they went down here into the neck, and they made another incision they pulled a little bit of fat tissue out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they use that essentially as glue to keep the eardrum closed, while it was healing right so that's that's the idea of like and then that's very common and most surgeries they'll take a little bit of tissue from another part of the body to help with the other part of the body okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, and that's totally fine in terms of rejection nice you don't reject yourself so you're the best match possible would be a twin So if you have an identical twin keep them handy.\nAndrew Ippolito: You never know where you're going to need a tissue okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's a whole world there to have cloning right so there's this idea of taking an animal that has been genetically modified to not have an immune system.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're called skid animals see severe combined immunodeficiency there's that's the name of the disease in humans.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, where you have to live in an isolated Chamber your whole life because you have no immune system and that's actually we can cure that now, with stem.\nAndrew Ippolito: Stem cells there things we'll talk about the end of the Semester. Andrew Ippolito: But you could take a skit animal and then you can put your stuff in there and then grow, you know they said, take a skid pig and grow a heart in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then now you have a heart that's not going to be rejected, this is the kind of stuff they're working on right now, but they haven't often they haven't perfected, all this, but i'm.\nAndrew Ippolito: Particularly deliver would probably be more a better idea for that, like the pig heart, I don't think in supporting human is just too small, I don't know unless it's a really big pig I don't know I don't know.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay we're talking. Andrew Ippolito: Like who cares we talked about this already skip that like oscillation we talked about that all right, the classic example of when this plays a role is in the blood system, the blood typing system so i'll teach you how this works roughly.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to tell you what i'm just going to teach you the very basic this will revisit this one, would you genetics okay well we'll really learn this in genetics so for now i'm just going to tell you that the blood type, you have a or B.\nAndrew Ippolito: plus or minus has to do with cell recognition proteins associated with the membranes of red blood cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so there's a protein and that protein comes in two types two flavors right a or B.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you get one from your mom and your dad. Andrew Ippolito: right if you get if both parents give you an A you're a type it both need to be your be type if long gives you they won't give you a beer one gives you gives you know you're a B type and then there's also a mutation that breaks the gene that doesn't give you any protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if you have if both of your parents give you a broken gene thanks mom thanks for nothing, then you have oh type blood.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so oh type blood is a mutated gene that leads to a non functional protein.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so if your mom gives you a and your dad gives you broken that's still a type blood that's the complexity here.\nAndrew Ippolito: You get two genes once broken ones good your blood type is, whatever the good one, is that right that picture to faucets in the same as long as ones on you have something there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, as for the plus or minus that's a separate gene is a separate protein, and you know, have a year don't that's called the memory you pay her this the rh factor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you're either rh positive or your rh minus negative. Andrew Ippolito: And so you can be oh type with an rh positive rotate within our reach minus and that leads to all the different blood types o o positive or negative HIV positive baby negative blah blah blah.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so it makes sense right if you get if you so i'm be on be positive Okay, so I have B plus blood not so bad right, it could be better B pluses okay right.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't have a type blood right so and then you get to a plus type of those are the best right now, this i'm just being ridiculous right now, but so be positive.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if you saw my immune system knows be positive it knows the be protein and it knows the rh protein which means I can receive any blood that has.\nAndrew Ippolito: Either nothing oh type I can go anywhere there's just nothing there to bother you about right, I can get be blood, but it has to be positive.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can't get a blood and I can't get negative right, I suppose you can get negative, you can give positive if you're rh negative, this is where the problem that we're pregnancy if you're a woman that has rh negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you marry, a man that's rh positive and the fetus developing inside you is rh positive that's a problem because your immune system has no idea what it's looking at and it might attack it.\nAndrew Ippolito: So your first pregnancy kid number one will be fine because your immune system is just getting to know this thing to attack it kid number two is when you're going to start having problems, and so what you do is you inject the mom with the antigen.\nAndrew Ippolito: The Orange the rh factor, basically, and you train immune system it's kind of like an allergy you train the immune system to not worry about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so if you've ever heard about these issues in pregnancy that's that's the fundamental basis for it and i've already spent too much time talking about this will focus more on this one, would you genetics i'll teach you more about that later okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So carriers and channels cell recognition receptors.\nAndrew Ippolito: receptor proteins are. Andrew Ippolito: essential for communicating between cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's that's the basis of it really receptors have a specific."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 2) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/TSzdFWFY-3I?si=eiyGPbHQrkDR2x2M","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Receptors","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of receptors and their role in binding to ligands to cause specific effects.","start":"30:14","end":"30:43","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Just like enzymes have substrates receptors have like.

Andrew Ippolito: living cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not dead bloated bodies. Andrew Ippolito: So, think of a rowboat with a leak it's not going to sink immediately, but as long as you can bail the water over the side quicker than the boat fills you can prevent the boat from singing.\nAndrew Ippolito: But if you start putting in the effort over time, the boat will sink, and so this leads us into this next section of active transport.\nAndrew Ippolito: or diffusing asked Moses, or both spontaneous processes active transport requires this cell to expend energy pumping molecules against their concentration gradient.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we're going to learn here about transport by carrier proteins. Andrew Ippolito: So after transport protein has two important things it's specific.\nAndrew Ippolito: And while and the obvious one, it allows things to go across the membrane that otherwise could not weather because they're charged or they're too big.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you can roughly categorize into two different types passive transport and active transport.\nAndrew Ippolito: Passive transport is sometimes referred to as facilitated transport or facilitated diffusion.\nAndrew Ippolito: See facilitated here, in other words it's helping its facilitation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I have to transport, when you see active there you're thinking energy. You need energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so facilitated transport is basically diffusion. Andrew Ippolito: it's a passive process it doesn't require energy to work and it's just diffusion across the membrane with some help and this happens for small molecules that can't otherwise go across the memory right so ions are a common one.\nAndrew Ippolito: So any of the ions we've talked about sodium potassium chlorine calcium, they all require their own carrier proteins, therefore, their own channel proteins okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now for active transport, these are proteins that use eight generally it's ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they will help the cell establish and maintain concentration gradients.\nAndrew Ippolito: which you could argue, is essentially what life is all about.\nAndrew Ippolito: Life is all about establishing and maintaining gradients.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're making the outside of the cell and the inside of the cell different.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the one example you're gonna get to know here is this sodium potassium pump.\nAndrew Ippolito: We touched on this last time, a couple times we've talked about this now we're going to learn how it works, the key here is that a typical eukaryotic cell."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 2) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/TSzdFWFY-3I?si=eiyGPbHQrkDR2x2M","chunkTitle":"Electrochemical Gradients and Cellular Transport","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the importance of electrochemical gradients in cellular transport.

Andrew Ippolito: They don't relate to each other, directly necessarily right they're just it's like temperature mph right two completely different things that we have to consider at the same time.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we talked about the cells electro.\nAndrew Ippolito: electro chemical gradient. Andrew Ippolito: This is a combination of the concentrations of the solids and the voltage difference.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why we want to think about this is. Andrew Ippolito: we're always considering this question which way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does it flow. Andrew Ippolito: what's it anything.\nAndrew Ippolito: glucose chlorine. Andrew Ippolito: malthouse insulin well I don't know insulin not if it's a bad example but, but the idea of whenever we're considering the flow of something in or out of the cell it's not just it's concentration gradient.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's not just it's charged gradients like there are instances, you can imagine, where something will be strongly negatively charged like chlorine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and we've learned that the inside of the cell is negative, and so you your intuition would be like well chlorine shouldn't get into the cell it's negatively charged going to be repelled.\nAndrew Ippolito: But what if there's no chlorine inside the cell and there's a whole bunch of it outside the cell, so the chemical gradient is extreme then it's going to go into this up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Even though it's negatively charged so there's two things to consider when we think about the flow of substances across the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, fortunately, for us we're never going to be confronted with specific nitty gritty detailed questions about this, this is high level physiology stuff that you're not going to get in this class okay just understand the concept of the electrochemical gradient.\nOkay.

Andrew Ippolito: You know if we have a carrier protein for glucose now we can move so so the really the underlying question is, do we need energy to do it or not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does the cell require energy to pump chlorine ions in or can it use just a passive channel.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the kind of consideration in a critical thinking that goes on, when we ruminate over electric chemical caribbean's.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we talked about you know cystic fibrosis and the chloride transporter so does chlorine just flow out of the cell, probably, so we have to pump it into the cell."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 7 (Part 2) - Membranes","link":"https://youtu.be/TSzdFWFY-3I?si=eiyGPbHQrkDR2x2M","chunkTitle":"Endocytosis and Exocytosis","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains the processes of endocytosis and exocytosis.

Andrew Ippolito: Whatever feature say to his fingers he I say figure psychosis that's a potato potato thing and then Pino site toes so figure means eat.\nAndrew Ippolito: And Pino. means drink.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right pinos where you come across in some wines right, so you drink wine Pino.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can see Figo psychosis under the microscope under the light microscope you can watch an amoeba eat apparent museum, for example.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can swap cells eat other cells, remember, we learned about set theory, this is the basis of set theory, this is our cells each other, because they told us.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is how we are immune system defeats bacteria, there are cells called.\nAndrew Ippolito: figure sites. Andrew Ippolito: That that's a class of cell there's all sorts of fake news sites so like maybe you've heard of macrophage or a monastery those are.\nAndrew Ippolito: Those are fake acidic cells. Andrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: You can't see people psychosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh go ahead, go ahead Angela.

Andrew Ippolito: i'm having a lot of trouble understanding you again, because the microphone issue.\nAndrew Ippolito: is like on the computer itself. Alexa Deprisco: No i'm using headphones. Andrew Ippolito: Oh. Alexa Deprisco: And i'm trying to like talk into the headphone.\nAndrew Ippolito: gotcha I can hear you better now. Alexa Deprisco: Okay, great so he said staging site, or whatever is that the one that does the eating or the one that is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's the one that does the. Alexa Deprisco: eating. Andrew Ippolito: If you're a finger stuff that's a great question.\nAndrew Ippolito: The finger site is the cell that does the eating. Alexa Deprisco: I think you know.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's no specific word I guess. Andrew Ippolito: Other than pray. Andrew Ippolito: The prey cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: The cell that got eaten all right Pino Santos is you can't see under the microscope you actually have to use an electron microscope and artists to observe it and the idea here is we're just non specifically scooping up liquid from the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this would be the equivalent going down to the creek with a bucket and just scooping up stuff from the creek right you're going to bring everything in that's in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's pinos I choose. Andrew Ippolito: reset but let's say you wanted to get specific things out of the creek so imagine taking a bucket.\nAndrew Ippolito: pop in the bottom out of the bucket and then putting some kind of mesh on there or filter or let's say you covered it with magnets and so now only magnetic things will come into the bucket alright so receptor mediated endo psychosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: receptor mediated endo psychosis is when we have receptor proteins in the membrane that bind to some specific like end.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so now, we will just bring that thing in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so if we want to reclaim something from the environment in a specific way we would use receptor mediated endo psychosis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so recap this. Andrew Ippolito: We can bring really big things in like other styles fagles psychosis we can bring in.\nAndrew Ippolito: The sub the solution in the water around us Pino psychosis or we can bring in specific saw you particles receptive mediated en dos Santos.\nAndrew Ippolito: make sense. questions.\nAlright cool. Andrew Ippolito: So there's there's an alert, so this is SEM, this is a scanning electron micro graph of an amoeba eating apparent museum.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a really beautiful picture. Andrew Ippolito: Whoever the the techniques needed to do that this is like master level photography stuff the fact that you can see the individual cilia on the parent museum cell, you can see, the underlying filaments of the membrane of the site oh skeleton This is just such an amazing shot.\nAndrew Ippolito: And on the left here this animation I forgot, where I got this from now, but the idea here is there's there's two concepts illustrated here, the first is called the kiss and run model.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the idea, there is that we don't just take a vessel in a cell it's not like a lava lamp it's not just.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's there's a specificity here so vessels are generally coated with proteins.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like like a skin and those proteins talk to the membrane so you can picture there's proteins in the membrane to and those secret handshakes that's the kiss the kiss each other and then, once they.\nAndrew Ippolito: lock it successfully that's when the fusion occurs so that's why on the left hand side that's why what you're seeing here is the vehicles on the inside of the cell see other bouncing a little bit first that's the kiss part.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's to make sure that the specificities there and then, once it happens.\nAndrew Ippolito: The membrane fusion occurs okay so that's The first principle illustrated here, the second principle that's illustrated is that so this side here that's XO psychosis right that stuff coming out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you look right here that's endo psychosis that stuff coming in and so cells, maintaining equilibrium, this is part of homeostatic control the amount of liquid leaving is equal to the amount of the food coming in, and so the cell doesn't gain or lose a net amount of volume.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you would say the rate of endo psychosis an extra psychosis is the same for cell that is maintaining equilibrium.\nAngela Harbeck: I have a question.

Taylor Campbell: I don't think he can hear us anymore.\nJordan Russell: it's like just more yeah that was yeah That was the Walker, but I think of war, like realistic.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah like adding on more stuff now that we have more knowledge so like I look there's more stuff.\nJordan Russell: it's just creepy because it's all jittery. Taylor Campbell: it's realistic.\nJordan Russell: yeah. Angela Harbeck: So what's the fibro directing is that, like the strand, and then the integration is just like the ball that holds it right Hello.\nAndrew Ippolito: you hear us fade to black. Andrew Ippolito: So what were you creeped out a little bit.\nAngela Harbeck: yeah. Andrew Ippolito: Like it's like Why is just proteins bopping around, why was that so damn creepy Angela What was your question.\nAngela Harbeck: My question was like the fibro neck done is that, like the string and then the integration is like the ball that holds it.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah sure if you'd like in the cartoony version of it yeah. Angela Harbeck: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, you're here let's go back to the PowerPoint.\nAngela Harbeck: there. Andrew Ippolito: Can you see that did I share my screen right. Now.\nAll right, great. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so. Andrew Ippolito: You can see here.\nAndrew Ippolito: where's my mouse. Andrew Ippolito: Right so there's a membrane right, you can see the fossil membrane right and then here's.\nAndrew Ippolito: here's the instagram profile boy they're really make this complicated don't think this is integration that whole thing Okay, and so you can see it's got this trans membrane part as the intracellular part and the extracellular apart the intracellular part buys to act in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, this right here is fiber neck didn't really these are probably.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are polymers actually this, so the fiber next in is probably just this alone, you can see there's filaments of it, and so the integration this component of the integration binds to the fiber next.\nAngela Harbeck: Okay, thank you. Angela Harbeck: um. Taylor Campbell: I have a question about our exam are you still working.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, yeah I have I finally everybody's taking it and so now, I can do my data analysis I just have to get around to it so right now in the in your head, just as a rule of thumb at 12 points that might be more than that, but right now it's 12.\nTaylor Campbell: Okay, thank you you're welcome.\nAndrew Ippolito: Tyler you said when you say cancer is when Okay, no, no, no, so um what one of the defense's."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 1) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/VPIrY7r7Bvw?si=ukm7hbtAYijOY50y","chunkTitle":"Chapter Eight: Energy and Enzymes","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces Chapter Eight on energy and enzymes in metabolism.

Andrew Ippolito: or usable energy and unusable energy useless energy I like to call it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, for example, right now in your room where you're sitting whether you're hot or cold, the air around you with some temperature.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you, you could very accurately see that the air around you has some energy to it.\nbut can you do anything with that energy. Know it's useless.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas the battery is in your cell phone.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's totally usable right you use that to drive your phone to do all sorts of the wizard species stuff ourselves can their phones can do now.\nAndrew Ippolito: So extra ganache means the reaction gives off useful energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas XO thermal just means it gives off energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: It could be useful or not useful and so now, you can understand the concept of info P, which i'll come a little while later from now well in therapy is is the total amount of energy system as.\nAndrew Ippolito: They call that the heat of the system, but really it includes the useful energy and they're not useful energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we'll build our way there today as we get there for now let's keep it simple here right, so this side of the slide here, this is your this is Chapter eight i'm sorry this is chapter nine, this is cell respiration as we'll get to it later okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can describe this reaction is a spontaneous. Andrew Ippolito: spontaneous chemical reaction is a reaction that will go to completion, without the input of external energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it doesn't mean it happens fast spontaneous doesn't mean fast it just means downhill.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And now we're gonna start to introduce this concept called cubes free energy gibbs.\nAndrew Ippolito: Free. Energy. Andrew Ippolito: And i'll teach you more, I have a whole slide on this later for now we'll just we'll just say that gives free energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can describe in this kind of downhill reaction, the system is losing it and so it's a negative number, because the system is losing it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that little triangle. Andrew Ippolito: There that's Delta, that means change.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you remember you guys remember this from your basic geometry classes change my change in next it's that triangle again Okay, but now we're changing g.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK so G is gives free energy. Andrew Ippolito: we're changing it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in this case we're making it lower so it's negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can think of this really you can think of this thing as the system."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 1) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/VPIrY7r7Bvw?si=ukm7hbtAYijOY50y","chunkTitle":"Building Reactions and Bond Energy","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains that building reactions require energy and absorb more energy than they release.

Andrew Ippolito: In other words, they will absorb more energy than they release.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, did you see how I said that they absorb more energy than they release we so they're releasing energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if we go back to the other side, there when we say extra ganache it gives off more energy than it absorbs oh wait they're absorbing energy, so one of the fundamental key concepts to understanding thermodynamics and chemistry and biology is understand the concept.\nAndrew Ippolito: That any bond any bond any any any bond ever in order to break a bond, you have to put energy in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay chemical bonds require energy to break them think of them like magnets.\nAndrew Ippolito: In order to pull a pair of magnets apart.

Andrew Ippolito: Remember electro negativity there's your strength.\nAndrew Ippolito: Remember oxygen loves electrons oxygens the strongest magnet here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and in fact you can kind of put this on a continuum here. Andrew Ippolito: like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So watch this. Andrew Ippolito: I want you to think of water now.\nAndrew Ippolito: What do you think what do you know about water if we just leave water hanging around what happens to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: don't overthink it don't think pH just think water would it's kind of a trick question.\nAndrew Ippolito: It doesn't doesn't do much. Andrew Ippolito: waters, a very, very, very stable molecule it doesn't just spontaneously break down remember pH is all about the breaking this apart occasionally let's put it back together again Okay, in other words, these bonds here, these oh each bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: are very strong bonds. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so this bond right here is a strong bond it's like a pair of really strong magnets.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what's that mean. Andrew Ippolito: whenever you break that bond, you have to put a lot of energy into it.\nAndrew Ippolito: What it also means and here's the Epiphany I want you to have is that when you make that bond it gives off a lot of energy.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: Because here's the thing the amount of energy that you need to put into the bond to break it is equal to the amount of energy that will be released by it.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's kind of like. Andrew Ippolito: It almost according to the simplistic views of this violates the laws of the universe, where there's no net change in the amount of energy there okay so so in order for me to break this bond let's see, I have to put in one unit of energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if I want to make that bond. Andrew Ippolito: it's going to release one unit of energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so now that you get that concept. Andrew Ippolito: let's go back to the slide now.\nAndrew Ippolito: And let's consider this molecule here.

He emphasizes the importance of establishing and maintaining energy gradients in biological systems.","start":"21:30","end":"27:46","content":"Andrew Ippolito: It kind of changed we causing here. Andrew Ippolito: It means some mass some matter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is displaced. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, if you want to look at the purest definition of this, we have some matter and at T equals zero was here and it equals ones it's not there anymore, and so we performed work on the system okay work is all about moving things in space and time.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, energy is the potential to do that it doesn't mean you have done that it means you can do that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so, energy is the currency of work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the more energy, you have, the more you can get done. Andrew Ippolito: But this is, I don't know what it's going on there, I have to fix that not right now, you can cash it in an exchange for affecting the object in question.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and we've all said this before right I just don't have the energy to work right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right sometimes you do, and you just don't want to wake up on Sunday refreshed happy you call your boss be like i'm not coming in today.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have potential energy. Andrew Ippolito: But you're not using it.\nOkay, good. Andrew Ippolito: So this work stuff here's another level of that useful energy exchange so when we see that when we talk about useful work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of it as directional work. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and what I want you to start to do now is put it in your head of the opposite of that kind of energy that kind of movement that molecules do that's random remember Brownian motion.\nAndrew Ippolito: Number how objects are just always juggling randomly remember that just Durban video I showed you, the other day, the other proteins in the cell kind of doing this that's not useful energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the opposite of useful energy. Andrew Ippolito: That chaotic movement.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so work is a useful energy exchange.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: So doing work on a system so notice how I say that work on a system you're not just doing work, what are you doing the work on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, you always have to consider the substance or the system and question that you're doing the work on so doing the work changes the kinetic or pencil energy of the thing you're doing the work on that's what's changing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so we learned this a long time ago potential energy so energy that's not currently doing the work that could do work that isn't doing work so So these are broad categories.\nAndrew Ippolito: potential energy okay so examples of potential energy chemical energy that example potential energy so when we see this carbon bond here.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talked about that bond having energy in it. Andrew Ippolito: That is called chemical energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: A battery has potential energy right so so um.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talk about voltage gradients. Andrew Ippolito: That would be an example of potential energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you take a spring and coil it tightly if you set a mouse trap.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you let it sit there and it's very unstable state but it's not snapped yet that's a coiled spring that's an example of having some energy inside of it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then kinetic energy is the act of doing the work so thermal energy, the energy that molecules have inside them that make them move we we call the thermal energy we I like to refer to that as intrinsic energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because that's what the chemists call it, people who are working in this field, people who study thermodynamics refer to that as the intrinsic or sometimes you'll see internal energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no, an intrinsic it's not internal that's a different thing okay so so when we say intrinsic it's it's within the molecule itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, like when you heat a bunch of water up and you make the water molecules jiggle faster that's thermal energy Okay, so, in other words the thermal energy is the mark is punching each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: And that's random remember Brownian motion that's just it's random you you're not doing useful energy with that it's still kinetic, though.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that that's an important distinction there a glass of water has energy in it, because the water is moving.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just doesn't have usable energy in it, you can't drive your car with a glass of water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because it can't do work why because the amount of energy, it would take to break those bonds is much, much higher than the amount of energy that will come out of the resulting.\nAndrew Ippolito: mechanical energy. Andrew Ippolito: Right what Julie, is doing right now. Andrew Ippolito: Right anytime we're doing any kind of movement.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so a cell moving through an amoeba crawling your muscles contracting.\nAndrew Ippolito: The filaments in during mitosis moving chromosomes around that's mechanical as simple.\nAndrew Ippolito: electrical energy that's that's the idea of voltage gradients building remember the sodium potassium pump builds up that gradient and then imagine so here here's a cell and we have that negative charge on the inside them positive on the outside, imagine, I had a.\nAndrew Ippolito: Protein here in the membrane that when I pushed the button it allowed the sudden flooding in of the positive charges okay so so ready, the key to life is the establishment and maintaining of those gradients.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because we can do work with that.

Andrew Ippolito: Right not not being a person, but being a person standing on top of a cliff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so like glucose itself is useless, you have to put it in the right context.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then that person in midair as a photographer took that picture.\nAndrew Ippolito: frozen in time, that person has had had a force act upon them, this is the force of gravity leading to their acceleration and they're falling downhill now literally until what until they hit the water.\nAndrew Ippolito: may cause some kind of reaction, where they exchanged, the energy with the water.\nAndrew Ippolito: and the resulting exchange leads to the dispersion of that energy into the system, so the water goes crazy you hear a big splashing sound.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now let's think about this for a moment let's let's say that they were going to do a belly flop.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no let's not let's say that say they were going to do a cannonball let's do a cannonball that hurts less alright so here's my question.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what's the point of a cannibal.

Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so I already explained, all this to you i'm going to skip through this, but here here so so every chemical reaction, you can think of as an energy transformation, we break bonds and then we make bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to remember the rules of chemistry Valence shells and reactivity and all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you break bonds.

Andrew Ippolito: But because we have an atmosphere, we have a blanket that slows down the openness compares to the moon, the moon doesn't have an atmosphere moons cold and dark.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it can't keep the heat so here's how things work.\nAndrew Ippolito: well. Andrew Ippolito: here's how things work here's the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's the earth. Andrew Ippolito: i'll tell you what i'll say, well, let me do some whiteboard.\nthere's something. Andrew Ippolito: I can do a little bit more here alright so there's the sun.\nAnd here's Earth. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and if we zoom into earth here.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can see that earth has. Andrew Ippolito: This atmosphere right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the energy of the sun here as the photons hit the earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: It warms up the earth, a little bit. Andrew Ippolito: All right, and then, on the other side.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, here let's do it this way. Andrew Ippolito: there's a massive amount of energy coming from the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we use it. Unless leaves.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's the analogy it's really let's say that it's dead of winter and your temper in your.\nAndrew Ippolito: Your heat is broken and you're in your bedroom and your bed on the surface of your bed.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're freezing So what do you do you put your sheet on.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: you're still cold. Andrew Ippolito: And so you put your blanket on.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're still calling you put your your down comforter on so now you got three layers, why are you warm now.\nAndrew Ippolito: How does that work. Alexa Deprisco: Because you're tracking your own energy that you're producing exactly right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, if this is your bed. Andrew Ippolito: here's your pillow. Andrew Ippolito: here's your head here's your stick figure body.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know what you're doing there you're just doing a push up the terrible picture here that's here you're just you're laying down there is your feet okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you're warm you're alive you're metabolizes it's not efficient you're giving off some energy right and it's going into the air around you and that's where you get cold and So what do you do you put your blankets, on.\nAndrew Ippolito: heat still in here, but now the air that's in between the blanket in you gets warmer and warmer and warmer but what's happening right it's still leaking energy out you've just slowed it down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's why you know plenty of people i'm sure that or you know somebody at least that when they get in bed they put 1000 blankets, on themselves because they're a cold and they fall asleep that way.\nAndrew Ippolito: You might be one of these people. Andrew Ippolito: And then you wake up at three o'clock in the morning and you're insanely hot and you're sweating you throw your blankets off and go back to sleep and you wake up an hour later you're freezing you put all the blankets back on, and you have this wonderful little dance at night yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why you do that, of course, is when you first put the first blanket on you're still cold.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you have the thought, I have to give it time for my own body to heat up the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then i'll be comfortable eventually right instead we all want to be warm now, and so we put all the blankets, on.\nAndrew Ippolito: But, but the rate so it's a great thing it's a flood it's called flux, the rate at which the energy is leaving is not equal to the rate at which is building up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so the more blankets, the more the sorceress and now let's go back to earth shall we the earth's atmosphere is a sheet.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the sun hits it and it makes it a little warmer and then it's more slowly radiates the energy back down to the earth into the space around it and so earth has some set temperature that is dictated by how thick the atmosphere is.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can start to see where this is going because here's the analogy let's say that you're in bed, and you have that sheet on and how that blanket on and you're still cold and you're down comforter is in the closet.\nAndrew Ippolito: At a play so you get up you go to the closet you take the comforter out you put it on your bed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we have a bunch of blankets, would you rather always be cold or hot oh that's a deep question i'd rather always be a little hot.\nthat's just me.

Andrew Ippolito: yeah I had a cold I hate cold I just some people love it not me.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's how we do it right, we go to the. Andrew Ippolito: closet and we pop the comforter earth has a down comforter trapped in the rocks.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right millions and millions of years ago, when the earth was filled with ferns.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is before the organisms we're evolving that could break down plant matter, and so, when a fern died when a tree fell in the forest and nobody was on to hear it, and it made no noise.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just stayed there nothing broke it down the whole earth was just piled high with all this deadwood.\nAndrew Ippolito: And slowly over time, that would got covered and buried and long story short that's what coal is that's why we call it a fossil fuel.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then oil is the same story, but with animals like dinosaurs so oil is dead dinosaurs and call this dead burn this is back from the carboniferous period carboniferous period.\nAndrew Ippolito: About I think three or 400 million years ago. Alexa Deprisco: Is there any reason why, like oil, then as a liquid and cold solid.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know the details of that, but there has to do with the way they broke down. Andrew Ippolito: So coal is dead plant and oil is dead animal.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so, in other words, we have sequestered all of that extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere attracted into the earth, and so what we're doing now is we're taking it back out we're taking it out of the closet and we're putting it back in the atmosphere.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is an example of thermal energy yeah yeah, so this is an example of. Andrew Ippolito: So the sun warming up the earth that's thermal energy and so we're making the air molecules vibrate more and more.\nAlexis Micewski: And more good so um the earth's atmosphere, I know, like has like a hole in it, so how does this affect.\nAndrew Ippolito: This. Andrew Ippolito: If this is the. Andrew Ippolito: earth that when we talk about the hole in the ozone layer. Andrew Ippolito: This it's not a hole in the atmosphere it's not like a vacuum it's it's a whole of it's a lower concentration of those and that's, not even a thing anymore there the ozone layer has been pretty much restored the 1970s.\nAndrew Ippolito: We were using a whole bunch of aerosols that had chlorofluorocarbon carp floral coral coral Florida carbons which basically went through a chemical reaction destroy ozone.\nAndrew Ippolito: Ozone protects us from UV light and because the Earth is rotating we would concentrate the ozone and the two hemispheres.\nAndrew Ippolito: But in the 1980s, when we pass legislation that ban the use of these things they're called each fcs slowly over time, the ozone layer grew back.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the ozone layer was actually restored we don't have we don't have that problem anymore, which is a good thing it's a great thing as an example of how we can affect positive change in our environment, when we pass laws that restrict the use of things that are hurtful for the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what we're doing today is we're releasing we're basically going to the closet and we're pulling out all of our comforters.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's easy to pull it out, but you guys all know this, when you want to put it back again you got a folded and you gotta do all this and put it back again right, in other words it's harder to put the carbon back into the ground, it takes millions of years.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, it takes the blink of an eye to light it on fire and put it into the atmosphere. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, now a tree you burn a tree.\nAndrew Ippolito: The carbon goes into the atmosphere and then the other trees around it breathe in the carbon dioxide, to make more trees that's sustainable.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay what's not sustainable, is tapping into the rocks and pulling out the carbon and then burning that because that doesn't eat there's no we're just adding to the cycle now.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what the greenhouse effect is the idea that we're taking our atmosphere and making it go from a sheet to a blanket, and so the whole earth overall is going to affect be affected by that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is not complex science this isn't rocket science, this is climate science.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and, as far as science is concerned, today, this is a near certainty that it's anthropogenic meaning we're doing it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, there are natural processes, yes, the sun goes through 14 year cycles, yes, there are sunspots and there is cooling of the sun and hating on the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: But we in our scientific investigations have systematically eliminated all of the other variables right we've disproven a and disproven be and disproven see and the only thing left is us.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we talked earlier in the Semester about not being able to prove things we haven't proven that we're doing it, we have this proven that the natural things are doing it, and the only thing that's left to consider is our activity.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the data is overwhelming at this point there's just as much data of anthropogenic climate change, as there is for evolution by natural selection and gravity.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's no scientists don't argue this stuff anymore, the only arguments come from people whose livelihoods depend on it not being there.\nAndrew Ippolito: The big oil companies knew about this back in the 70s and they sat on it."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 1) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/VPIrY7r7Bvw?si=ukm7hbtAYijOY50y","chunkTitle":"Conclusion","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito summarizes the laws of thermodynamics and emphasizes the importance of sustainable energy sources for the future.","start":"55:02","end":"59:06","content":"Andrew Ippolito: The big oil companies knew about this back in the 70s and they sat on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah it's all coming to light now they've had some of some of the most brilliant scientists in the corporate world have been sat in front of Congress in the last two years and they've admitted it all.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is just just making big headline news anymore, because there's other things going on in the world there are more important like viruses and stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: right but there's other things happening it's just it's out of the mainstream media because it's just it's just there's a lot to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think about and talk about, and do so, yes, the the oil companies had all of this data.\nAndrew Ippolito: All of these data showing that their work was going to eventually lead and they actually their climate models were spot on they predicted everything that's happened so far from their their models from the 1980s predicted everything that's happening today.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, but now. Alexa Deprisco: Excuse me. Andrew Ippolito: yeah go ahead. Alexa Deprisco: Do you think there's any correlation between how like like super bacterial one and then coronavirus to in relation to how we have affected the climate and how it's like I guess like overall hotter.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean, things do move faster and hotter pair but I don't think there's necessary correlation between the temperature of the air and the speed at which the buyers is being disseminated.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think that, instead, so the reason we have the pandemic is because we can move from point A to Point B on this planet, like we never were able to before.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a lot of buyers with their incubation periods and they're shorter incubation period, so we can you know we can be in ruin China, and we can be in southern California.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the time span it takes for the virus to just started not regulating was that was never possible before right, I mean, even in the last in the flu, the flu pandemic the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Spanish flu back in the 19th century early 1900s the reason why there was such a thing as people were getting affected and then going home for World War one and all the troops were coming home on the ships and that's how it spread.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's a lot of it's all about us being able to move fast and that's how it spreads so so amazingly fast and it's ridiculously variable and buyers.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's it's are not is extremely high compared to other viruses.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we'll talk more about that at the end of semester, if we have time i'll teach you guys a little bit about virology but let's get back to this here okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here are the laws of thermodynamics right the first law is very simple, you can't make or break energy you can't create or destroy energy all you can do a shuffling around so we see energy is conserved.\nAndrew Ippolito: The, this is a universe thing not a system thing. Andrew Ippolito: So, so, in other words, you could say simply that the universe, is the closest.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's outside of the universe I don't know but we'll just call that part of the universe, then shall we.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright what's outside that I don't know, but whatever it is, is part of reality too so we're just we're just we use this word universe to describe.\nAndrew Ippolito: existence, you know and as far as science is concerned, the universe is infinite in three dimensions, if you just start flying in one direction, and just never stop you'll never reach in that.\nAndrew Ippolito: In that hurts our puny little in our puny little finite minds. Andrew Ippolito: I know it hurts mine i'll just speak for myself.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so you can't make energy that's that's The bottom line you can't make energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't destroy energy. Andrew Ippolito: You can't destroy a photon.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so I like to say, you can only use what you have, there is no more.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the first law.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and then this is the opposite, this is not spontaneous we got to go up hill we got to put energy into the system and that's what plants do so plants get the energy from the sun and they build their sugars and that's the basics.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so these are intergalactic reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so Tory here we go here's where we start understanding free energy. Andrew Ippolito: So the first thing is is this concept, the concept of free energy, this is the ability to do a useful process like build a sugar molecule or build a DNA molecule or build a nucleotide okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: As opposed to just warming things up. Andrew Ippolito: Right.\nAndrew Ippolito: That you can think going back to her here my cards again remember I card analogy imagine, I did throw all these on the ground.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and I got on my hands and knees and I could do a couple things right, I could I can pick them all up again, I can put them back into an altered state.\nAndrew Ippolito: I could go one step further and put a lot of energy and time and and build a car Castle there right there on the floor, or I could just show it just move them around like this right, I could just use my hands and just shuffle the cards around that those are all inputs of energy right.\nAndrew Ippolito: The question is what's the difference between them and the answer to that has to do with the entropy right when I when I just move them around randomly i'm i'm adding energy but that's not useful energy that's temperature.\nJordan Russell: Right so. Jordan Russell: So what thermal energy fee like well so like thermal no no wait, the thermal energy would be like a form of free energy because it's not.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, the free energy would be you directing your muscles to build a card Castle okay there's a thermal energy is thermal energy."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 2) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/QKc6CQEOsjk?si=CooC-2n4Rq1DF_92","chunkTitle":"Delta G and Entropy","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the relationship between delta G and entropy.

Andrew Ippolito: that's available for work and then there's energy in the system that is not available to work, it is inaccessible, you can do anything with it Okay, so you can think of this as kind of an x plus y.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where X is. Andrew Ippolito: equal to the useful. Andrew Ippolito: And y is equal to the non useful.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that makes sense right, I mean there's a total that now some systems don't have any useful energy in it and so X would be zero.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there are no systems, I can think of, where y is zero. Andrew Ippolito: or just pure useful energy that's just and why because everything's always vibrating a little bit okay so there's nine useful component.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want you to think there's a temperature there okay so again when I say temperature you're thinking this you're thinking tremors you're thinking vibrations.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you can't not have that why that's how atoms are think of the electrons whizzing around the atom like a gyroscope.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you ever play with a gyroscope before you pull the string of the things going super fast and the kind of wobbles just a little bit that's what all atoms are they wouldn't be Adams otherwise.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's just call that T. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and then there's a chaos, which is not something you can just look at and get and put a number on that's why we went to the degrees of freedom stuff before right, but just we're going to call the entropy s.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you multiply those two things together, and you get some magnitude of useless energy you can't do work with temperature and you can't do work with chaos.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then we're going to just say gee instead of X, because we call it gives free energy but it's really gives doesn't own it he just discovered this process well enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: to the point where we popularized by naming it after him Okay, and so that's where you get this equation H equals G plus T s.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 2) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/QKc6CQEOsjk?si=CooC-2n4Rq1DF_92","chunkTitle":"Gibbs Free Energy","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces Gibbs free energy and its significance in metabolic reactions.

Andrew Ippolito: All we're going to talk about is the order part this molecule goes from this to this for changing structure or breaking bonds were rebuilding them to new bonds temperatures, not a factor temper so temperatures a constant.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's no delta T here. Andrew Ippolito: OK, now that S, on the other hand, is everything that's the difference between what carbon dioxide and water looks like versus glucose that's what that concept of what they look like their orders trapped in that number s So yes, we are going to consider the changes in entropy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And because of this equation we're just going to multiply that by T so there's your T delta X.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this here when you see that delta you're thinking that's your friends analysis, this is the reaction before, this is the reaction after.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's changed.

Andrew Ippolito: there's a direction here and the direction here the concept is here's the system.\nAndrew Ippolito: The system is either losing energy. Andrew Ippolito: Now I just felt lacing instead of losing losing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Losing energy. Andrew Ippolito: So that's negative or or the system is gaining energy and it's plus.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so you have a negative change in the free energy or a positive change and the free energy.\nAngela Harbeck: To free energies vector you said yes. Andrew Ippolito: Because it's got that arrow.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so it's got a its got not just a magnitude, but it has a charge, not a charge, it has a.\nAndrew Ippolito: plus or minus side. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so so just like we don't have there's no such thing as a negative dollar bill.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right like here is minus one dollars know we talked about owing $1.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's minus one that's an accounting trick, this is an accounting trick there's no such thing as negative energy there's a loss and we represent, that with a negative sign.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that negative is not the same as a negative for and electrons charge or or an accounting sheets naked free we just use that negative for different things, maybe we should have different signs for that, but we don't that's which is explained some people's confusions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so because we're interested in both in a mountain interaction gives free energy is a better quantity.\nAndrew Ippolito: And don't ignore the bottom of the screen now so energy is never negative in the same way, money is never negative there's no such thing as a negative dollar bill, we talked about energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: being lost or being gained mathematically we use a negative and a positive so negative free energy minus G is when a system, we are concerned with is losing energy and positive free energy is when the system is gaining energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Everything has some energy already remember Brownian motion and so that means that we consider positive negative energy we're really talking about changing the amount of energy, this is the mass.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we're talking about changes in the free energy of a system.\nAndrew Ippolito: So in math we use the delta sign, and thus we write a change and gives free energy delta g."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 2) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/QKc6CQEOsjk?si=CooC-2n4Rq1DF_92","chunkTitle":"Negative and Positive Free Energy","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of negative and positive free energy.

Andrew Ippolito: The average human being, gives off the equivalent amount of heat of a 60 Watt light bulb a tungsten 60 Watt light bulb, we have to say now.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if you've ever tried to change a light bulb after burst it's really hot to touch right too hot you don't want to touch that you want to wait for it to cool off slow down.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you can't slow down you got it put like a ray on it, or something on screen that's hot that's how much you're given off throughout your whole body, not in one concentrated point because our metabolism 100% efficient.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this goes through everything we already did i'm going to skip all this here. Andrew Ippolito: And I want to say this now chemical reactions here we're going to leading to enzymes now so so breaking bonds requires energy forming bonds releases energy we talked about this already strong bonds require more energy to break down weak bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you know what I suppose you can add to this strong bonds release more energy.\nVictoria Bloemker: than weak bonds and i'm quick not sick. Victoria Bloemker: Because.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a good story. Victoria Bloemker: Direct message you and I said sit question sort of quick question like auto corrected.\nAndrew Ippolito: autocrat wait what i'm so confused i'm sorry. Andrew Ippolito: No, no, no don't see nevermind so there's my hearing and me being.\nVictoria Bloemker: I am. Victoria Bloemker: I direct messaged you I say. Victoria Bloemker: Oh, but it auto correct. Andrew Ippolito: Oh sick question you're looking at, because you look like confused when you're looking down, I was like oh.\nAndrew Ippolito: I just saw that i'm like why that was a sick question. Victoria Bloemker: yeah I didn't mean to say that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you guys still see sick like that anymore. That was sick.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know I haven't used that word in years myself anyway what's what's your. Victoria Bloemker: quick question oh i'm so for the second law, could you say that entropy of the universe only increases.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah the you know if you've taken the whole universe itself that's that's our closed system, and so you would, so the second law states the entropy of a closed system increases over time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so that key there that closest in part that's that's, the most important part because open systems allow you to go against entropy and do things like evolve life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so that's why you have to be careful with you ever have an argument with somebody or a debate with somebody about evolution and they tell you that evolution goes against the natural order.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can tell that person that that is not an accurate statement because you are you you're invoking the second law of thermodynamics and the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy increases in a closed system.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not an open system, and so the corollary to that is entropy will decrease in an open system.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's actually mathematics now there's there are people working on this notion that life itself is an emergent property."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 2) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/QKc6CQEOsjk?si=CooC-2n4Rq1DF_92","chunkTitle":"Bond Energies and Free Energy Changes","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of bond energies and their relationship to free energy changes.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so every chemical reaction itself, you can think of as having a little accounting table next to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of the energy in and the energy out and then you have a total.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of that total is negative, or that total is positive that's what we're talking about here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, because again remember temperatures constant if temperatures constant.\nAndrew Ippolito: The free energy is the thing that's going to be changing so zach remember the other day, you were talking about delta each.\nAndrew Ippolito: You were asking like does this mean delta delta G, so I was thinking a lot about that question afterwards cuz I didn't I don't feel like I give you a great answer for that and so now that we're here and i'm thinking about it more because the temperature is constant.\nAndrew Ippolito: The only two other variables, there are the free energy in the entropy, and so we can see here.\nAndrew Ippolito: The entropy is going down i'm sorry the entry is going up see I just did it the entropy is going up here as we move from the left to the right or increasing the chaos Okay, and so the free energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: has to also go up to compensate. Andrew Ippolito: Because it's it's it's eight minus Ts right and so we're going to release i'm sorry i'm sorry the free energy has to go down.\nAndrew Ippolito: The the free energy has to go down as the entropy goes up to keep everything the same and So where does that energy go it gets released from the system and we use that we use that energy to do something else.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so when you look at this slide here this now starts to give you the, so this is on the Internet, this isn't in your book, but this gives you the concept we're gonna break these 23 chemical bonds we're gonna break the six chemical bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there's 29 total chemical bonds, in other words one complex molecule and six simple molecules so Tyler when you say complex again there it is okay there's complex meanings or not chaos.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then on the right hand side, you can see that we have only 24 bonds and we have 12 simple molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so you can kind of use this as a proxy to determine which way the energy which way the chemical reaction is going to go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is it going to go from the left to the right of the right to the left is going to go uphill or downhill downhill, which way which way is downhill that's the simplest way to think.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's going to go downhill.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, and then here we can look at actual numbers, so, if you look at this chart right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This gives us what are called bond energies or maybe maybe bond enthralled piece I forgot how they officially cause, but like just looking at the.\nAndrew Ippolito: News bond energies, thank you. Andrew Ippolito: So carbon oxygen has what does that say it says 78 oops.\nAndrew Ippolito: No, why are you telling me to. Andrew Ippolito: Sorry guys, I have to.

Andrew Ippolito: All right, so.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, I love this likes the color coded it too so let's let's consider that one bond here the CEO and it says 78 times seven What that means is this single bond right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: That requires that either either that requires 78 units of energy to break or it will release 78 units of energy when it's made.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's that's the strength of that book, so if I take glucose here and I add up all those numbers and which is what this table is doing here, this is saying there are seven co bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are five o H bonds seven ch bonds and five CC bonds and each with these accounting numbers, so we add all this up and this says 2182 kilocalories Okay, so I need to put in an order break all those bonds, I need to add 2182 units of energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then here's the double bond oxygen you can see it's 116 and there are six of those so when you add all this up together, you get 3564.\nAndrew Ippolito: kilocalories input. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, on the right hand side of the equation, you can see, we have oxygen bonds to hydrogen so there's water, and then we have these in carbon dioxide, we have these pairs of double bonds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Look at these numbers, so that so that's the first intuition years Look how strong those bonds are carbon oxygen double bonds are 187 kilocalories.\nAndrew Ippolito: versus a carbon oxygen single bond, which is only 78.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what that means is when I make these bonds they're going to make enormous thunder claps they're giving off tons of energy, when you add up this side of the equation, you get i'm sorry i'm sorry guys what I did this backwards in my head this side had 2878.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's how much we had to put in to break all those buttons on the right hand side we release 3600 3500 684 3564.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, in other words, if you made it an investment if you took $2,878 and you put it into a stock and then immediately it rose and it went up to and you sold it at $3,564 you've just netted 686.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that right there you would see the delta G there is 686 kilocalories.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a number, you should burn into your head actually that that's the free energy of a glucose molecule 66 that's a good number to have.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay Now the question is is is that a negative or a plus you tell me what what should I put next to that we're going from a glucose molecule to hydrogen to water and carbon dioxide."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 2) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/QKc6CQEOsjk?si=CooC-2n4Rq1DF_92","chunkTitle":"ATP and Energy Transformation","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses ATP as an energy transformer in cells.

He also introduces the concept of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in ATP hydrolysis.","start":"48:25","end":"54:01","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay Now the question is is is that a negative or a plus you tell me what what should I put next to that we're going from a glucose molecule to hydrogen to water and carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: minus minus because we're releasing the energy good, so what that means is we get that energy, the environment, gets that energy and we can then go and do stuff with that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like make ATP. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so so you can do this exact same thing with ATP we're not going to do this, but i'm going to give just give me the number here, so when I take ATP and I go down to a dp plus inorganic phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: That change and free energy. Andrew Ippolito: So you would say the hydrolysis of ATP the free energy of the hydrolysis of ATP is negative 7.2 kilocalories.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see how the numbers way smaller than 686. Andrew Ippolito: That that tells your brain, that means that I can use that energy from sugar to make some glucose i'm sorry to make some ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in other words you have enough money to make this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so going back to the investment strategy analogy you just made $686 on your investment, you can now turn around and go and buy something for.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, you can't really buy something for $686 right so going back to our stock analogy, why can I do, I really have $686 in my account after all that.\nAndrew Ippolito: What do you have to do when you when you sell a stock. Andrew Ippolito: have to pay taxes on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they're really high, especially if they're short term profits it's like 25%.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that 6086 dwindles down now to maybe $400 we can still make glucose molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: right and it turns out, when you look at the math here, I remember earlier, I said 30 you can make about 30 ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: When you do the math here when you multiply this by 30 and you compare it to this number it's about 30%.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's your efficiency. Andrew Ippolito: So what about where's the 70% going heat entropy temperature chaos.\nAndrew Ippolito: And no you won't need to know how to calculate any of this what i'm trying to do is put it further deeper into your mind and how all this works.\nAndrew Ippolito: And for those of you who are mathematically inclined right quick show of hands, how many of you were kind of mathematically inclined you got math in your head and you're okay with it yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm talking to you guys for the rest of you, like me, where you're like Okay, I get me, I mean I get math but I don't think in math germs some people do this is good for them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So work through this slide on your own if you can work through the slot on your own and chew on it and make sense to you, you got free energy okay so i'm just going to leave this as well, so so next week, when you come to me, maybe ask me stuff about this slide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right. Andrew Ippolito: So, but really both of these slides Okay, these are these are spontaneous reactions and non spontaneous reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so be able to puzzle your way through this and understand the the impact conceptually on the math you don't have to ever do calculations, but you should have an intuitive understanding here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so now we can start almost get to enzymes here ready, so this slide here shows you on the left hand side you have some amounts so so the.\nAndrew Ippolito: y axis here is is G is free energy. Andrew Ippolito: And so you would say that glucose has a lot of free energy in it, to start with, and then, when you're done with the reaction it went down So you see here the key here is this big gap.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is that represents the change in the free energy from start to finish.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, because we're going from high to low we have lost energy, this is a negative delta g.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK and contrast you go the other way okay you're going up Hill, this is still the change and free energy, but this is now a positive change and free energy we started with low energy we end with higher energy, this is going up Hill, this is, this is not spontaneous.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this is a slide that puts it all together for you, you can use this as a study as a study slide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so do you see what I did here so on one hand we put extra Yannick, on the other hand, we put Andrew Yannick and we associated.\nAndrew Ippolito: Each of these concepts, with one side or the other, so it's either releasing or absorbing energy it's either considered negative or positive delta G it's spontaneous or not spontaneous it's part of a catabolic process or an anabolic process.\nAndrew Ippolito: Including the hydraulic reactions hydrolysis versus dehydration synthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then stability it's either more or less stable so be able to this, this is your master map of this whole topic.\nOkay. All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so now we can start talking about biology, so these concepts as applied to biology there's chemical work there's mechanical work and there's transport work."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 2) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/QKc6CQEOsjk?si=CooC-2n4Rq1DF_92","chunkTitle":"Enzymatic Reactions and Electron Exchange","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains enzymatic reactions and their association with electron exchange.

Andrew Ippolito: And so you can think of a cell as a microscopic chemical factory.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's producing millions and millions and millions of reactions every second all the time long as it's alive.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can also think of those little energy transformers like the thing down the road that helps take your energy from the power plant to your neighborhood.\nand go to step down transformers. Andrew Ippolito: Okay alright So how do we go a pill.\nAndrew Ippolito: That we talked about this, the idea here's your ATP cycle, this is in your book now, and you can understand this let's just walk through this very quickly and i'll tell you what i'll reconstruct this so here here is some breakdown process some catabolic pro.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some catabolic process. Andrew Ippolito: It releases energies that plus or minus delta g.\nAndrew Ippolito: What am I right and right here.\nLiberal. April Neeld: Would it be minus good.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now For those of you who are like plus what you're thinking in your head is if this is you over here you're like I got some energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: But that's not what this is about that sign isn't you that's not the environment that's the system, the system lost it for your game, so the system last energy negative delta g.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, and now we get this ATP stuff and you can cartoon ATP out maybe as a circle, with three phosphates on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the charge battery. Andrew Ippolito: triphosphate at okay and we're going to integrate it we're going to hydro hydro hydro lies it.\nAndrew Ippolito: To a dp and all adp is a circle, with two phosphates on it, plus another phosphate that came off it broke.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so, when this breakdown happens it's releasing energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is that so what am I writing right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anybody. Alexa Deprisco: Energy. Andrew Ippolito: So my.\nAndrew Ippolito: delta G is this plus or minus delta G O plus. Andrew Ippolito: So you want to say, plus because I wrote that over here is minus and so you're like well this has to be plus but you see what I did.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm losing energy again on this side i'm going from ATP to a dp I am breaking this down and see this hour is going downhill so i'm also releasing energy here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is all cellular work. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so so watch this This is where the plus delta he comes in i'm going to go from a dp up hill to ATP that's my plus delta g.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, and then the cell work whatever i'm doing making DNA roots of the mechanical work that transport work or the chemical work that's where the plus delta G is going to happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: So ATP is the middleman. Andrew Ippolito: ATP is the conduit through which the energy flows.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like a watermelon. Andrew Ippolito: Like a chemical waterman okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's the slide down here that's from your book, you can hopefully understand that now.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so let's let's add this word here when we say phosphor ELISE and what we mean is we're going to add a phosphate group to a substrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so in this case, we have a dp plus phosphate we're gonna fast, so you would say this we're going too fast for lead EDP to etv.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to D phosphorylation ATP guide alexa.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to ask question. Andrew Ippolito: Oh, I saw the little window around you and I thought I heard them okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So there it is that you just I just gave us Oh, and I said 7.2 before I was wrong 7.3 I always get that wrong i've you know i've seen that 7.2 other what other blessing, maybe different books use different values.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, okay. Andrew Ippolito: So we can actually walk through here let's do so reaction one ready, so this slide has a lot of noise on it and it's overwhelming so pay attention to me.\nAndrew Ippolito: And where I direct your attention to is chemical reaction one here is a glucose molecule we're going to add a phosphate to glucose we're going to get a reaction to go that's going to give us this product glucose six phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's just a glucose molecule that's phosphor they didn't know and some water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, if you see here the change in free energy is plus 3.3.\nAndrew Ippolito: Plus 3.3 we're going up Hill, this is an underdog reaction, this is not a spontaneous reaction this doesn't just happen by itself.\nAndrew Ippolito: We need to couple this with something here's a reaction to here's a tip and water we're going to hide your lies ATP ATP we're going to rip off that phosphate we're going downhill, the change in that free energy is negative 7.3.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So you see here this phosphate that's this phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to take the tps phosphate and we're going to rip it off and put it on the glucose that's essentially what we're doing here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And when you look at the delta G and you're compared to this one Okay, when you take.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have given off 7.3 we need 3.3 that is an overall net change of four and so you can say these two reactions when you mash them together ready glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: Plus ATP yields glucose six phosphate plus EDP basically take this take this reaction and take this reaction and take the left hand side of this reaction on the left hand side of that reaction and mash them together and you get this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And do the same thing with this side and you get that. Andrew Ippolito: And you add it all together, and if that final number is negative, you know that when you put those two reactions together it just happens it's spontaneous and that's the point of learning about free energy and biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: When we study the metabolism, we want to know which reactions are going to happen by themselves, and which ones aren't.\nAndrew Ippolito: By by understanding metabolic reactions, we can then start to understand how we can regulate them how we can target them for drugs or therapeutics etc, etc.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So really part two here, this is this is going to just flow downhill like an enzymatic reactions now it's going to be pretty easy to understand, compared to everything else.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so we already understand a chemical reaction as this exchange of energy right the shuffling around about atoms or molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: The key here is that the exchange occurs in the form of electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay electrons make the world go round.\nAndrew Ippolito: and recall that breaking the bond requires energy. Andrew Ippolito: And that different bonds require different amounts of energy to break so some bonds are easy to break some bonds are hard to break some molecules are easy to break some molecules are hard to break sugars are easy to break fats are hard to break."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 2) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/QKc6CQEOsjk?si=CooC-2n4Rq1DF_92","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Metabolic Pathways","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concept of metabolic pathways and how they are mediated by enzymes.","start":"1:03:06","end":"1:03:20","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so a metabolic pathway is a chain of chemical pathways mediated by a series of enzymes, so you can write a metabolic pathway like this, a goes to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right catalyzed by enzyme one.

Andrew Ippolito: So for a chemical reaction to actually happen, what has to occur let's think about this let's go into the minutia we talked about the forensic analysis now let's talk about the middle of the story.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the molecules have to physically bump into each other right they have to collide, and not just that they have to collide, and a precise orientation.\nAndrew Ippolito: right if they bump into each other the wrong way they're not going to react, they have to react, they have to be in the exact same position that the right position in order for the chemistry to happen.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they have to be able to hit each other hard enough to get over each other's electron clouds because remember electrons push each other away right so two things are like two magnets they don't like each other so Ram them together.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can understand that temperature is going to play a role here right the hotter, it is the faster they're hitting each other."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 2) - Energy and Enzymes","link":"https://youtu.be/QKc6CQEOsjk?si=CooC-2n4Rq1DF_92","chunkTitle":"Enzymes and Temperature","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the effect of temperature on enzymatic reactions and the importance of the enzyme's ideal temperature.","start":"1:04:42","end":"1:05:26","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can understand that temperature is going to play a role here right the hotter, it is the faster they're hitting each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: and eventually some maybe that was confusing to you here's some molecule here's another molecule these things all have electrons right they're all electron clouds.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are all just a little negative, these are all little negative at the end of the day, you got pairs of other you got electron clouds that have to punch through each other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right to overcome that repulsion you have to push them faster. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's a there's a temperature.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why, when you increase that's why you heat things up to make them go faster you're increasing the rate of collisions and you're allowing them to overcome what's called stark hindrance.\nOkay.

Andrew Ippolito: You see, that do you notice I didn't write I didn't inhibit enzyme to.\nAndrew Ippolito: or enzyme three why because get choked off at the source.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's see what the most amount of energy.

Andrew Ippolito: Little hole in the back.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and imagine that there was this molecule here let's make it read.\nAndrew Ippolito: There was this little square molecule that when it snuck over here in the back and a bound what that resulted in.\nAndrew Ippolito: His him shutting his mouth. Andrew Ippolito: We changed his sheep we changed the shape of the active site, do you see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so. Andrew Ippolito: If we have a substrate over here hey if we have 1000 substrates the same it doesn't matter the mouth is closed, take a rubber band and tie it around your stapler you just need one rubber band.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's site is called the other site it's distinguished from the active site, the other site and, of course, scientists don't like saying things like other site, we have to name it something fancy so we call it the aloes Derek site that literally means other place.\nAndrew Ippolito: aloe means other. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's the Alastair excited, so this is called an aloe static inhibitor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is synonymous with non competitive inhibitor.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can say non competitive.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that's that's where we're going to end today on TV let's take a quick whirlwind tour, to see what we didn't hit today.\nAndrew Ippolito: I think I hit, most of them, we already talked about it yeah okay that's gonna be we're right where we need to because here's the thing understanding the docs that's going to bleed us right into photosynthesis, and so we are exactly where I want to be This is great so.\nAndrew Ippolito: We talked about inhibition here's just another slide on ambition, you can use this for your studying so i'm not going to cover this next time we already covered it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Practical uses this is this is. Andrew Ippolito: Brain candy you're not gonna are just contextualizing your information, I don't have to teach you this, you can just read about it.\nAndrew Ippolito: We already talked about metabolic pathways we have this idea of intermediate points okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: We talked about feedback inhibition already.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah, so this is we're gonna pick up right here, this is going to be, you can think of this as the beginning of Chapter 10 even though it's not this is This is fully in this chapter eight, but this is where i'm going to start chapter 10 okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: The the idea here, as you guys work through your weekend the idea here is that energy flows through biological systems by being piggybacked on electrons Okay, so if you can track the electrons through a system, you can track the energy through a system."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 3) - Energy and Enzymes - and Lecture 9 (Part 1) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/d4Nb7xOnkc0?si=5i4YgpsxRl18y2BP","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Redux","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the concept of redux and explains why it can be difficult for students to understand.

Andrew Ippolito: A has some.\nAndrew Ippolito: electrons hanging around on it it's got some bonds doesn't matter what's going on okay don't worry about the molecular structure just understand the fact that there's an electron President of course there's an electron present they're everywhere right everything's at electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And remember that electrons. Andrew Ippolito: electrons absorb energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so that that electron can enter into a higher state right that electron can can get.\nAndrew Ippolito: High in energy you think of like getting hot a little bit. Andrew Ippolito: So I want you to realize that there's two kinds of electrons right there's there's hot electrons and there's called the electrons so here let's use.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's use a different color here let's make this green or red like it's hot.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some, like it hot some like a cold some like it in the pot nine days there you go okay so let's say like this electron last energy.\nwe'll see gain energy. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so this is basically this is you go on the sun and you feel something and and you can imagine the energy being absorbed.\nAndrew Ippolito: By an electron OK. Andrew Ippolito: So the point of this is there are different kinds of electrons and what i'm about to teach you is it's independent of if the electrons hot or cold.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's some other molecule hanging around let's call that molecule be.\nAndrew Ippolito: A molecule be is angry, because he doesn't have he's got a strong like this he's got like.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's got a wound that can only be filled by an electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so what's going to happen is an electron is going to get transferred to go for a ride.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's get the positive and be so in this point here, you could say that you can see that be gained an electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, now the electron that again was was the hot one right. Andrew Ippolito: You see how that's that's a red ones you, you could also say that be gained some energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: might be gained some energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: In biology. Andrew Ippolito: This is how energy in the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: Always is transferred. Andrew Ippolito: In the chemistry through electrons bopping around.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so we go from we take a high energy electron from a and we hand it to be so now be we can literally do this watch I can just take him and I put them over here now that didn't work, let me try that again.\nAndrew Ippolito: This really doesn't like. Andrew Ippolito: Come on mouse thing there we go there, I just took it over there, so you so any lost it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: A lost be gained.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to see the story from both perspectives, you have to see this story from his perspective, a lost the electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you have to see this story from beast perspective be gained an electron. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: one's losses and others game, and that is always true there's always a winner and always a loser, this is a zero sum game.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this idea of redux that's why we called redux Okay, we will get there, almost we're almost there Okay, so what I want you to do is think about the charge now what happened to as charge.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we say a lost and electronic right. Andrew Ippolito: And we'd say that be gained an electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what happened to ace charge is charge what.\nAndrew Ippolito: Did he go up or down. Andrew Ippolito: What did it lose.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the what's the charge of an electron. Andrew Ippolito: Negative so it lost the negative So what does that mean to its.\nAngela Harbeck: charge oh wait no. Andrew Ippolito: No that's okay and that's why I asked this question though it's deceptively simple right it's a double negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: I lost a negative, which means I gained a pot I didn't gain a positive but but I net might my net charge went up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: As charged up as charge went up right plus one.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, these charge went down one. might as well.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so ready, we could say that bs charged got reduced.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: Be beast charge went down being charged got reduced so the the gain of an electron is associated with a reduced charge right so we're going to call it again and electron reduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's the concept reduction is the gain of an electron. Andrew Ippolito: see this as a positive thing, even though this is a negative thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is good, we just got some energy that's the general idea, the general idea is the electron that we get is generally higher in energy than the one that we didn't have before."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 3) - Energy and Enzymes - and Lecture 9 (Part 1) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/d4Nb7xOnkc0?si=5i4YgpsxRl18y2BP","chunkTitle":"Reduction and Oxidation","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the concepts of reduction and oxidation in the context of electron transfer.

Andrew Ippolito: You would say a is a re ducting.\nAndrew Ippolito: You would say a is reducing be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we are telling the story from beast perspective. Andrew Ippolito: hey I just got an electron i'm happy I just got reduced hey he's the guy he just reduced me thanks a you reduction you.\nAndrew Ippolito: write this all makes sense, so far it's easy okay now so let's tell a story from the villains perspective now so a is a victim he's really upset that I just got its electron stolen from it.\nAndrew Ippolito: I didn't give my electron to be he stole it he's a thief.\nAndrew Ippolito: The problem is everybody's walking around town saying that be really loves electrons where we heard that before.\nAndrew Ippolito: What am I what am I ingrained in your brain who loves electrons.\nAngela Harbeck: isn't an oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: Yes. Angela Harbeck: That is exactly right. Andrew Ippolito: oxygen loves electrons that's why i've been telling you this all semester, because now it's going to pay off the loss of electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Be that jerk stole a's electrons be oxidized day.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay oxidation is the loss of an electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: So you would say that. Andrew Ippolito: You would say that a.\nAndrew Ippolito: got oxidized.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: Be. Andrew Ippolito: oxidized a.\nAndrew Ippolito: B is an accident.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So in real life when we have somebody stealing something from somebody else that's different than somebody giving something on their own accord great.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's like the bully coming home from school and saying to his mom hey mom look with joey gave me today and joey coming home from school and saying billy stole my pokemon book.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right joey got it stolen from him he didn't give it to billy but billy's claiming that he got it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right in in in this world, nobody cares what you think because molecules don't have personalities.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right. Andrew Ippolito: You either gave or it got stolen the endpoints the same right Joe Joe the endpoint of Joe is his name, he doesn't have his pokemon book anymore, whether he gave it away freely, or he got it stolen from him he doesn't have it anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so, one of the reasons why this is challenging is the same reason why delta G is challenging do you see now there's two sides to the story which 1am I supposed to be in the answer is always the same, the system.\nAndrew Ippolito: The object under consideration is the important one Okay, but in this case there's two objects on your consideration.\nAndrew Ippolito: You have to be thinking about both then. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so what I would do is pick one doesn't matter, whichever way your brain works best pick one or the other oxidation reduction doesn't matter which Okay, and then just consider the story, whoever got it.\nAndrew Ippolito: got reduced or, if you like, the other way of saying it whoever lost it got oxidized.\nAndrew Ippolito: just pick one it's kind of like your left and your right, you know, most people would like the left side and they know that they're left is on this side so writes the other one.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's how I do it every time I have to look at something like go left to right I just think I know left is on this side I just I can just say that on my head rights always the other one.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, maybe i'm crazy everybody's got their own way of doing left and right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so whatever you do for left and right is now what you do for redux.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: All right. Andrew Ippolito: So simply put.\nAndrew Ippolito: There you go. Andrew Ippolito: And then you can also memorize.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oil rake. Andrew Ippolito: oxidation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is loss. Andrew Ippolito: reduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is gain reduction is game that's something something from 1984.\nAndrew Ippolito: pieces war.\nAndrew Ippolito: or not war is peace I forgot how they put in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Big brother's watching you.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so now that you understood right raise your hand if you understand that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good because now, now we can think about we can plug this in to."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 3) - Energy and Enzymes - and Lecture 9 (Part 1) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/d4Nb7xOnkc0?si=5i4YgpsxRl18y2BP","chunkTitle":"Photosynthesis and Absorption Spectrum","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the process of photosynthesis and the role of sunlight in providing energy for plants.

Andrew Ippolito: Is it rains down the series of photons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And photons come in different wavelengths.\nAndrew Ippolito: delta wave links that are on different chain change with different wavelengths right, so we got we got long wavelengths.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and we associate long wavelengths with red light.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have. Andrew Ippolito: shorter wavelengths.\nAndrew Ippolito: Until we get. Andrew Ippolito: Pretty tight.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and to the point where we get to blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: And if you think about this conceptually, this is the electromagnetic spectrum.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we're doing here is we're looking at a very narrow range of wavelengths on the order of about me see if I can do this about.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want to say 300 nanometers ish about 300 nanometers to i'm sorry other way around, other way around, these are, these are the about 300 nanometers.\nAndrew Ippolito: So that's what we're measuring it from peak to peak. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so we're on the order of hundreds of nanometers about 700 nanometers.\nAndrew Ippolito: For red and again, these are ballparks I don't have them I should have these numbers in my head I just don't okay so from here to here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's the visible spectrum we call this, this is the visible spectrum.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, understand that there's. Andrew Ippolito: A very, very I mean there's a near infinite spectrum here it's math so if this is on the access, this is a these are let's see these are hot thousands of meters.\nAndrew Ippolito: 1000 meter wavelength okay it's like radio waves.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so a radio wave and blue light are made out of the same thing just different wavelength.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you got radio waves on one side, then all the way here, on the other, where you're down to microns you have gamma rays.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, those are the things that are shooting out that's cosmic radiation. Andrew Ippolito: out in space it's deadly.\nAndrew Ippolito: Before gamma rays, you have your X rays, which are also deadly at high doses.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then you have your UV light which is dangerous if you stand outside too much.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then you have your your visible spectrum.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then you have your. Andrew Ippolito: infrared.\nAndrew Ippolito: which you feel as heat when you put your hands by a fire it feels hot Okay, those are photons to, and those are the only order of like centimeters.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then you have microwaves, which is what we used to cook food. Andrew Ippolito: and your radio waves and I might have missed something in there, but those are those are the ones we come across it, you know everyday life, you get your radio you got your microwaves got your infrared.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know we're all giving off heat we're all we're all emitting photons if you ever think if you've ever seen thermal imaging sensors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or the old movie predator right where you see people, you can see, you know the color scanning of people, you know the red if they're hot they're blue or cold.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's black if there's no heat right what you're seeing, there is the differences in it's a gradient thing right, so the environments cold.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you're hot you're going to be able to distinguish that you're going to be able to have contrast there right, and so a lot of the what, when we talk about.\nAndrew Ippolito: cloaking devices and we talked about in the military, we talked about and miserable plans planes are invisible the radar right the idea there, it will.\nAndrew Ippolito: Definitely that's radar is different than what i'm about so infrared so we have tanks that are invisible to infrared right and the key to, that is, they are the exact same temperatures are ambient temperature and so they can't distinguish them, and so they look like nothing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so if you want to be like think of Harry Potter is invisibility cloak imagine having a cloak.\nAndrew Ippolito: or any covering that is automatically you know through some fancy sensor technology, the same exact temperature of the air around it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so I said, even for it anyway. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's let's step back now so that's that's the concept of the the infrared spectrum or i'm sorry the the electromagnetic spectrum sometimes you'll see that abbreviated as e m.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay electrode or the EMF electromagnetic force right photons to exert force, however, light like when however light it is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, like okay. Andrew Ippolito: a light touch that's what life gives you it's a light touch you're touched by like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So here's here's the next cartoony step we got a leaf right.\nAndrew Ippolito: I got this awesome little leaf in the plan.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the sunlight shines down. Andrew Ippolito: All the different colors hit the leaf, of course, right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why are leaves green. April Neeld: Because they can absorb green light, so they reflected.\nExactly good. Andrew Ippolito: Green i'm not going to write the word green and yellow that's just confusing the luck out.\nAndrew Ippolito: there. Andrew Ippolito: Right green light is reflected.\nAndrew Ippolito: Most of the other colors are absorbed. Andrew Ippolito: In so you can think now something got some electrons just went up and energy right remember remember that, if this is an atom remember that electrons can go from one Shell to another Shell right that's that idea of quantum leap right, we can go up.\nAndrew Ippolito: electrons can go up and so that's what we're doing and and also remember from that idea that when electrons go up in energy they're unstable.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, in other words, you can imagine, these electrons that we're dealing with here are so unstable they're getting so pumped full of energy they leave.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so whatever had them. Andrew Ippolito: just got what we just are oxidized.\nAngela Harbeck: oxidized. Andrew Ippolito: Excellent you got it. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so something in them, so if we really to zoom in here there's something that gain some energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: gain photons right, and then the electrons got so pumped up they go away.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so what we're going to watch here is we're going to basically bounced this electron downhill until it lands.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's say boy it lands into some high energy molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so we took sunlight we pumped the photons into some chemical bonds which are electrons We then handed those electrons off downhill until they landed somewhere kind of stable.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like glucose. Andrew Ippolito: So there's your there's your Annapolis, driven by the sun there's your producers okay so we're going uphill here we're going uphill by getting we're getting pushed up hill by the sun basically.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, raise your hand this making sense. Andrew Ippolito: Questions okay Angela give me a question.\nAngela Harbeck: So does that, like the molecule that the electron life does that die then.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a great question okay. Andrew Ippolito: So here watch this let's say that this is the molecule and adjust it has this like deepening wound in it right, the electron just left.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so that that's a great question so like here, this is this is like a wound right, this is a very, very right, this is very positive, now, because just lost the electron right Okay, so it turns out what this thing is going to do, is it is going to find a replacement electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's cold. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and guess what guess where it gets this one from the most stable thing on earth well, one of the most stable things on earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in other words, this thing this blue little square that I just drew is such a powerful accident right, this is an oxygen now right because it's it's ripping electrons away from whatever from water in this case.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so think about that it's breaking water is ripping an electron from water.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're burning water. Andrew Ippolito: And if you think about that, like what do we usually use water to do we put fires out with water, and here we are lighting water on fire, this is by far the most powerful oxygen on the planet.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in biology I don't know if there's a super oxygenated chemistry, but. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to learn about this later on i'm giving you I don't want to use any words, I just want to give you the concepts okay so yeah so the plan grabs a bunch of photons.\nAndrew Ippolito: It pumps those photons and just some some electrons those electrons get passed down Hill and what's left and it's week is this gaping hole that has to get filled, and so it finds a cooled off electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so remember this goes back to that idea that not all the electrons that you get are necessarily high in energy Okay, and so the idea here is, you can imagine, in this case, this electron from water is a cold electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the electron that left is a hot electron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so So the idea here this blue square thing gets us electron water.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then it pumps that cold electron full with sunlight until gets hot and when it gets hot enough, it leaves and then, as long as waters present it's going to grab some more that's part of the reason why we need to water plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is why we need water and now there's a lot of leads me to water right we remember us Moses, and the central vacuum and keeping plants all happy, but this is the other reason why water is essential for photosynthesis because water serves as an electron source.\nAndrew Ippolito: That we're then going to use to forge sugar. Andrew Ippolito: So this is our pig iron.\nAndrew Ippolito: That we're going to mind from the earth and we're going to forge instead of swords we're going to forge glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's kind of allied to it's not really glucose but we'll get to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so any other questions up to this point.\nalexa you look very confused. Alexa Deprisco: So is this all relating back to like what does sounds so stupid, but like why, like the plan is green.\nAndrew Ippolito: No that's not a stupid question that's a great question everybody wonders that question they look at plants, they start learning this stuff like, why are plan screen, so it turns out.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's only a subset of electromagnetic energy that those two is that this blue box i'm talking here, like the one that's absorbing the light.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here i'll tell you what let's start giving you words now there's this thing in the cell there's this thing in the chloroplasts called of photos oh boy i'm writing in highlighter that's terrible there's there are these things, called photo systems.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, a photo system is a complex.\nAndrew Ippolito: made out of things like proteins and organic molecules just it's a complex that absorbs like.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and they don't just absorb any light. Andrew Ippolito: They actually will learn about something called.\nAndrew Ippolito: An absorption spectrum. Andrew Ippolito: Right so here let's let's give you an example, one so here watch this.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I shown light so here here's wavelength.\nAndrew Ippolito: And here's absorbent let's abbreviate that ABS that's absorbent how much of the of that wavelength is being absorbed by the system so right let's just as a control, just as an example here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, what this tells us is that, whatever the substances that i'm just making up here this wavelength is maximally absorbed whereas this wavelength over here is not absorbed at all.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so you can read that now, you get that idea Okay, so if we look at.\nAndrew Ippolito: The substance that absorbs light, so you can now understand that as a pigment you've heard that word your whole life now you know what it means a pigment is a molecule that selectively absorbs some wavelength of light.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's whether colored. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so the most common pigment that we're going to deal with is chlorophyll which you've also heard about i'm sure before.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and it turns out there's two chlorophyll there's chlorophyll a in chlorophyll be.\nAndrew Ippolito: None of that usually use a MB not alpha it's like they usually I italicize these it's not Alpha and beta it's A and B so chlorophyll a is the most abundant a for a button and then there's be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so if I look at the absorption spectrum for chlorophyll a it turns out, it does something like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, and this spectrum here is all visible light, this is Roy g.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean it's not necessarily in that. heroes track.\nAndrew Ippolito: Smart like that. there's g.\nAndrew Ippolito: Roy G bb. Andrew Ippolito: where's G and their core is green.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's why plants repeat. Andrew Ippolito: chlorophyll a does not absorb any so look at the other colors are hanging out there to think of the colors of fall.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's oranges and yellows Okay, the colors that plants need most well think about a greenhouse think about the color of the light in a greenhouse what color is it what does it look like.\nAndrew Ippolito: You ever seen a light bulb that is specific for plant growth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like a UV light it looks like a UV light right and we can't see your view, of course.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so the other one we have so UV lights emit UV but then there's also a bleeds into the spectrum, you can see right that's why we can see it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, those are high high energy right, I mean UV is very high energy so that's the blues that like electric blue color that, like the really, really intense blue light that's the favorite color of plants that's the color that keeps them going.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: that's this little peek right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the rest of this. Andrew Ippolito: Is the other side of it. Andrew Ippolito: that's the reds the oranges so i've actually thought a lot about this like Why is this the spectrum.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so here's what i've come up with I don't know if this is right. Andrew Ippolito: But you know plants evolved on earth was so so we know the reason why they absorb visible light and not like gamma rays, is because that's the energy that makes it to the surface of the earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you think about it, this is the surface of the earth now see this is the atmosphere.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when the sunlight shines down only some subset of that energy makes it all the way to the surface, where the plants are and that happens to be what we call the visible spectrum that's why we see it, because we have both here too.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we don't see any of those wavelengths that they'll make it here we can't see gamma rays, we can't see X rays.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can make them in the lab but they're invisible to us. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, our eyes evolved to see the most useful colors for us to hunt and to avoid predation and whatever it's all it's all you can see everything now through the eyes of evolution.\nAndrew Ippolito: no pun intended there, you can see everything through the eyes of evolution and it all makes sense it all fits into place.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, think about when the sun first comes up in the morning. Andrew Ippolito: What color is the light.\nAndrew Ippolito: Beautiful morning, or when the sun's going away at night, what what color is the light. April Neeld: orange red.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there's that. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's why I think you know, the second person comes up it's cool alright so here's here's my follow up question why aren't leaves black.\nAndrew Ippolito: When why don't we just catch all the light and make as much energy or put as much energy into molecules we can why can't we use black why aren't leaves black.\nVictoria Bloemker: wouldn't they like dying. Victoria Bloemker: Because they get too much sun. Andrew Ippolito: awesome That is exactly right tori you've got an you just jump right to that answer to that was great okay you're thinking exactly where you need to be yeah they get too hot.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so the question is is where's the sweet spot we have competitors, we have other photo synthesizers that are taking our son.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so there's competition there, it turns out this spectrum is the best spectrum it's the most bang for the buck it's the most energy without getting too hot to do nature enzymes and."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 3) - Energy and Enzymes - and Lecture 9 (Part 1) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/d4Nb7xOnkc0?si=5i4YgpsxRl18y2BP","chunkTitle":"The Role of Stress in Evolution","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the significance of introducing stress into the environment for evolution to happen.

Andrew Ippolito: Peter join it. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so on that note let's dig into the mechanisms here, then the time we have remaining.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm going to give you the overview here alright so first of all photosynthesis occurs in either the chloroplasts eukaryotic cell or within you can think of the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of a pro carrier right the program like is the chloroplasts remember chloroplasts evolved from pro carriers, as far as we understand.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: And so there, there is a piece of green algae on the upper right there um I forgot his name.\nAndrew Ippolito: it'll come to me like stop thinking about so, so this is a protest that is a green a single celled free living green algae so that's why we don't call it a plant it moves plants don't move that thing moves.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then there's cyanobacteria and you can see he's got those styler coils hanging around on the outside there, whereas the green algae has a single law his most of his cell is filled with a single chloroplasts.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right he's basically chloroplasts on wheels. Andrew Ippolito: he's got a might have caught he's he's got mitochondria there too.\nAndrew Ippolito: So understand that, actually, the majority of oxygen we're breathing in is not coming from plants it's coming from these guys or things like this out on the ocean.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the open Ocean is just filled with green algae and you can just picture oxygen just spewing off of the ocean constantly.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's our source of oxygen Okay, so if every single plant on earth in the terrestrial environment was burned and destroyed we wouldn't suffocate because we still have the ocean.\nAndrew Ippolito: If we do ever have a meteor impact Okay, what happens here, this is earth and we have a meteor hit us fast enough.\nAndrew Ippolito: Such that it's spews up dust into the atmosphere for miles eventually the air currents take that and it goes throughout the entire atmosphere and the sun gets blocked out for a good six months.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then everything dies. Andrew Ippolito: Okay that's when all the algae in the atmosphere and on the ocean dies that's when we would have to start worrying about not being able to breathe.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's not just where's their where we're getting our food it's I can't breathe Okay, the last time that happened that was about 70 million years ago and the dinosaurs went extinct.\nAndrew Ippolito: That was the last group, and that would they call that the great dying, oh no i'm sorry they don't call that one the great time there was one even worse than that, but never mind that was the candor cambrian That was the cambrian explosion 95% of all life on Earth died.\nAngela Harbeck: Because it was. Angela Harbeck: They got exploded, no, they were just suffocating.\nAndrew Ippolito: For the yeah the dinosaurs supposedly suffocated and well everything green died so anything that relied on eating green things died.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, anything that a lot of new those things died, it was just a big it was kind of like dominoes domino def.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah the cambrian death that that's that mean almost all marine life died, too, and then what came after that was the cambrian explosion.\nAlexis Micewski: So you just reminded me i'm meant to share there's this board game that my friend brought over it's called oceans.\nAlexis Micewski: it's basically you create your own like species and you evolve traits and stuff and you fight over resources and like attack different species, but after a certain point you go through the cambrian explosion.\nAlexis Micewski: doubles and it moves like justice fast. So. Andrew Ippolito: i'm going to look that up that sounds like the perfect biology game, thank you for telling me that oceans I gotta remember that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right, I got three minutes, so there is a plants multicellular algae single celled algae and then we have what are called a purple sulfur bacteria, they have the unique pigment that they don't use chlorophyll they use an alternative pigment and they use instead of.\nAndrew Ippolito: oxygen they use eight hydrogen sulfide.\nAndrew Ippolito: As a source of. Andrew Ippolito: As an oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas we use i'm sorry i'm sorry, you know what.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm getting things backwards just don't feel sad anything i've seen about purple sulfur bacteria I don't know enough about them to talk intelligently I kind of learned something the other week about them and it just popped out of my head.\nAndrew Ippolito: They produce high they produce hydrogen sulfide you know the black cookie sledge stuff you find in the swamp that's now kind of bad it's just that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or if you ever if you've ever had an old pipe and you've had to take a pipe apart it's just the sludge it's literally like sledges hydrogen sulfide."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 (Part 3) - Energy and Enzymes - and Lecture 9 (Part 1) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/d4Nb7xOnkc0?si=5i4YgpsxRl18y2BP","chunkTitle":"Firefly TV Show Reference","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito references the TV show 'Firefly' and its passionate fanbase.

there was this issue of it's on one hand, it said the enzymes unchanged.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the other hand, it's it's slightly changed right so what's the difference there it's all about context.\nAndrew Ippolito: When they see the enzymes unchanged, with the mean is that, when you start the reaction, the enzyme looks like this and then the reaction doesn't stuff and then at the end of it all the enzyme looks like this, and if you look at the before and the after it's the seat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, in the middle there in the meat of the story that we're glossing over during our forensic analysis of a chemical reaction, the enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: Changes a cheap a little bit when it binds to its substrate Okay, the analogy, there is imagine a baseball glove or softball glove it doesn't matter but it's got to be one of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the idea is it's it's large enough to hold the ball easily in its middle right, and if you think about it when the ball comes into the glove what's the globe do it hugs it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: It changes, a cheap a little bit or imagine putting your head down into a pillow the pillow kind of.\nAndrew Ippolito: cuddles around your head it's not you know it's not like putting your hand on a piece of wood that would not be comfortable right the pillow.\nAndrew Ippolito: changes its shape to meet your head the contours of your head, especially memory foam memory foams, a perfect example of this Okay, so this concept of slight change that's called the induced fit model.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we used to think that an enzyme and a substrate interact with each other in the same way that a lock in a key interacted they call that the lock and key model, the problem with that.\nAndrew Ippolito: is in your head when you're thinking about locking the key neither of those mechanisms, neither of those objects changes their shape really.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, if you think of the key going into the key slot what's happening on the inside of that if you've ever seen the way a keyhole works is you have these little.\nAndrew Ippolito: These little slats of metal little metal cylinders that move up and down right but they're all rigid metal okay and contrast an enzyme is kind of more like silly putty in that it's going to bend around a substrate so that's one thing we buy slightly change versus not changeable.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay next question."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 - Special Topics - Osmosis and Free Energy","link":"https://youtu.be/V7k8Fh45TA8?si=rQUFcTToI9OQhxzf","chunkTitle":"Energy Coupling","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses energy coupling and provides examples such as the sodium-potassium pump and the ATP cycle.","start":"2:48","end":"7:59","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This is good stuff.\nAlexa Deprisco: In the book, it was talking about energy coupling and it's the use of an extra organic process to drive and undergone and what would an example of that be the sodium potassium pump.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, and no so the the idea, there is not yes i'll say yes, yes, but that's a complicated example there's there's easier examples to wrap your head around.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason why I said yeah so is he yes, the idea, there is you put energy into build the gradient right, but then the question is like what do we do with that gradient and the answer is there's so many things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so let's think about one one simple thing the cells do that some cells, then that is the action potential which we're not covering in this class, this is more of a physiology thing but, but basically a neuron.\nAndrew Ippolito: Does this all are non response it's either going to elicit an action potential so it's kind of like a little electric shock or it's not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, in order for a neuron to do that, there needs to be a pre existing gradient already established in its environment so for example here, this is the neuron here's the the neurons head and then you have this thing called the axon.\nRight.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the idea is the sodium potassium pump builds up this gradient.\nAndrew Ippolito: All lots of the inside of the neuron the inside of the axon is negative, and the outside is positive because of the sodium potassium pump so we have established that gradient we put some energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's intergalactic right and then let's just say something happens, and what that does is it causes a very rapid opening of channels, such that the sodium rushes into the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: instantly and what that does is it causes the neighboring channels to open, and so what you end up having is this very rapid what's called the polarization of the membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is kind of like a branch that catches fire Okay, or if you've ever seen the movies, where they got the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Somebody blowing up the gas station and they they pour the gas, all the way up to the street, and then they dropped the match on the gas, and it was wrong.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that traveling of the flame down the gasoline that's kind of how an actual potential is it as an analogy okay so and that would absolutely be a extra ganache reaction it's it's being it's releasing all that energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: A much simpler example would be the ATP cycle, which is what you'll you'll see I think in this chapter, the ATP cycle is basically try the triphosphate Okay, and you know the Di phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right adenosine triphosphate adenosine triphosphate so you can think of the ATP, this is the charge battery.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so you can imagine a little if there was a little battery single symbol kind of like you have on your phone.\nAndrew Ippolito: This would be the fully charged battery right and then adp would be kind of like.\nAndrew Ippolito: The flashing like we can't do anything now our batteries too low right and then, and then a MP really that there, there is a continuum here don't worry about what this is that's a secret.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is secret knowledge that you you'll see this at the end of the Semester good so remember that picture I remember that let's see if you can remember that all right going away now okay you got a MP, the model phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: And and that's that's when you're at like critical levels and you're like should I throw this battery out or not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so so ATP to adp high to low that's going to give off energy to do some work and so will kind of energy all sorts of stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or will see a slide here today there's three basic kinds of work that cells do there's mechanical work there's transport work and there's chemical work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so think about enzymes doing their thing think about sodium potassium pump doing this thing and think about me busy doing their thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so those are the three basic classes of work that sells do, and most of that work, almost all of that work is fed through ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Not all of it, but a lot, most of it Okay, and so, when we have the EDP remember we eat our food, we have all those catabolic reaction down here, we got like calluses on will learn about cell respiration and the Krebs cycle and yada yada yada.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that energy from those breakdown reactions comes in here and puts the energy back into a dp to make it ATP let's charge the batteries back.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so that's the coupling the idea of our food over here the breakdown of our food the tablet over food is coupled to the building up of the ATP energy and then the ATP energy lets us build anything we need.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, great question."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 - Special Topics -

energy, and how they relate to extra ganache reactions.","start":"8:01","end":"23:17","content":"Alexa Deprisco: So then, just to follow up really quickly so then like when you're eating food and it's being broken down the energy that would be released as the ATP that you can go on to us.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean like, no, no.\nAndrew Ippolito: Careful there the energy that's being released.\nAndrew Ippolito: is so i'll give you a little quick thing here there's glucose glucose is a six carbon molecule that's that's got some features in there right 668 1206 right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we're gonna do with that we're going to see in glycol says there is a series of 10 chemical reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and really early on there's one where it breaks in half into a pair of three carbon molecules and in that fall down hill at the bottom of the chain here, so this is a six carbon molecule 123456 this is going to be a three, and this is going to be a three, these are called pi reveal.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in the process, what this does is we take this empty bucket called any D and we're gonna fill it with some energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we're going to go and use that energy to go make some ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in a process will we'll talk about later, so this full bucket would be called nadh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so basically we're trapping a pair of high energy electrons in there Okay, and all of this comes down to electrons, and this is stuff we'll talk about in more detail so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so that's the basic idea, though, so there are these complicated chemical reactions these catabolic reactions that feed.\nAndrew Ippolito: The monster of the ATP machinery right it's all that's happening in the mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right now, yes, there is a little bit of ATP made here there's there's basically two net ATP being meeting like houses to.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay that's that's 2% of the energy and the glucose that's hardly anything Okay, at the end of all this again this this part over here requires oxygen, but if you got oxygen there and you're doing all the good stuff ideally you're making up to 30 ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is about 30% efficiency.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a win okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: next question or thought or concern or just where's your where's your brain hitting a mental block on this stuff and you can't get past it.\nVictoria Bloemker: For me i'm like stuck on gives free energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah willard.\nVictoria Bloemker: Good old willard gibbs okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, I have a.\nAndrew Ippolito: good for you, I have the whole slide on that today so well we'll dig into that in grotesque detail.\nAndrew Ippolito: anybody else so yeah so tori i'm not ignoring your question i'm saying, well, it will definitely absolutely answer that.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the PowerPoint.\nAndrew Ippolito: Any others are you guys want to get going on on the media today.\nAndrew Ippolito: And by the way these kinds of questions you're asking these are amazing questions I love these kinds of questions feel free to ask these during my lectures.\nAndrew Ippolito: don't think of my lecture as like it's not like a Ted talk where i'm up there on a stage roaming around and I don't want anybody talking to me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, I mean I might come across that way, sometimes just because of the way I chat but i'm I like people stopping me, but you do oh just hold on a second, can you go what's going on over there, that makes absolutely no sense to me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then i'll and when you do that, that that stimulates my brain to come up with a new analogy or to think of it in a completely different way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so, so please, I know that it's uncomfortable to interrupt people, and if you really don't if you really don't like being like Dr to eight.\nAndrew Ippolito: nevermind just type something say I have a question type, I have a question, then, you know, then i'll notice it and then i'll stop and then you can ask your question okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, Tyler says, is it possible for entropy to increase when free energy both increases and decreases.\nAndrew Ippolito: I remember reading something contradiction okay okay so that's another that's another example of like what the enzyme situation it's all about the context of what you're learning about so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, first of all let's make sure we understand the cost of entropy so Tyler do me a favor what, in your opinion, your own words what's entropy mean to you.\nTaela Shahid: Just increasing complexity.\nAndrew Ippolito: Did you say increasing or decreasing complexity.\nTaela Shahid: increasing complexity oh interesting.\nAndrew Ippolito: I like I use the word complexity there so, so in that context.\nAndrew Ippolito: What do you mean by complexity.\nTaela Shahid: Like things get more chaotic there's just more.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what I thought you were gonna say, which is good okay so So when I hear complexity.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm thinking order not chaos here's why think about the difference between a car that's put together.\nAndrew Ippolito: and doing its job and so think about associate how complex that is right, think about how complicated the moving parts in the car.\nAndrew Ippolito: And now take all the car imagine you know, everybody knows somebody who can take a car engine apart and put it back together again right and again, not a single bolt is missing.\nAndrew Ippolito: My hat my father in law is one of those people he showed me his show you these pictures of the way he does it is he'll he'll label everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: little piece of the tape and sharpies and like it's a nightmare, and then he puts it all back together again.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's yeah not not for fun, I mean he's rebuilding engine, sometimes, and this is back when he was younger he's he's older now he doesn't do stuff like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it was a mechanic back in his day part time he's a lawyer now he's he's been a lawyer for his entire life really so but, before the lawyer part he was a mechanic he's a brilliant engineering type.\nAndrew Ippolito: brain and so he could take the whole car apart, and so I want you to just think imagine imagine instead of doing it his way we did it like let's pretend it my way I would never do this, but I would say everything apart, I just throw it on a bin.\nIt just.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is a rattle it up there's my engine right that's a mess right so so the difference between that bucket of parts and the beautiful engine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is that the engine is put together and it's ordered in this wonderfully complex way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Whereas that bucket of bolts is just chaos there's just it could be in any order in any way anywhere okay so So the question so ty let's see we got this which one of those systems, the bucket of bolts or the beautiful car has more entropy.\nTaela Shahid: Car.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, so the answer is the opposite and what you're doing is exactly what I did when I first learned this and here's why you're doing it.\nAndrew Ippolito: As humans, we are storytellers right we like a good story, we are builders we built the car.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right we're builders, so what we want to do is, we want to associate some value to the thing we like to do building.\nAndrew Ippolito: or telling a story putting putting something together not breaking it apart, although there is something very cathartic about destroying something right.\nAndrew Ippolito: we've all had to use a sledgehammer to break something or you know just there's something very I just blow it up and it feels good you guys have cathartic there's a word for some of anybody who will catharsis is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's say that you have all this pent up frustration about something.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right let's see if somebody in your life that just keeps doing something just greeting on you, for months or years and, finally, one day, you just lose your shit and you're like I just will you stop do.\nAndrew Ippolito: You feel like crying and you just like you just cut this like emotional breakdown and you start yelling at them and they're like I had no idea you didn't like the sound of my chewing.\nAndrew Ippolito: right when you just did that feeling where you're like and then afterwards, like oh my God, I feel so good, to get that off my chest.\nAndrew Ippolito: stop eating with your mouth open right when we do that that's catharsis catharsis is that release of of negative emotion and it feels good afterwards okay so.\nAndrew Ippolito: So our brains are all about the building.\nAndrew Ippolito: entropy is the opposite of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's kind of like the addition makes sense multiplication makes sense division.\nAndrew Ippolito: got it you got to kind of think two steps away entropy is one of those things.\nAndrew Ippolito: So entropy is a measure of chaos it's not a measure of order, which is what our brains want we wouldn't it be nice if it wasn't measure border, because then it would make more sense to us Oh, as this thing gets built up it gets more of these numbers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right instead is getting less of the numbers.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's kind of like understand the difference of the pH number and the exponent being negative right What do you mean it gets bigger to get smaller Is this a riddle what is this okay so entropy.\nAndrew Ippolito: is a measure of how far along a system is along with equilibrium journey right so let's go back to the car now okay so Tyler get this you got the car thinking, I was going to happen in that car for the next hundred thousand years, is it always going to look like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's going to happen over time, inevitably.\nTaela Shahid: it's gonna break down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Of course, and that's what entropy is a measure.\nOf.\nAndrew Ippolito: entropy is a sad thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's the end of the story it's health how much time do we have left that's what entropy is a measure of.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you're watching your favorite TV show I just finished watching that this last month I just finished watching agents of shield marvel's agents of shield anybody watched any of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh, a couple of you have you watched the whole thing you don't with it okay yeah so the last two seasons are just what they're just campy cheesy weirdness.\nAndrew Ippolito: They were still good at the end of it ended and it's very satisfying so if you're if you're a fan, you should definitely watch it through the end but um.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, you can imagine you're like Oh, this is the last episode, how many minutes, do I have left, how many minutes, do I have left, right that's entropy because you're just inevitably getting to the end.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so now let's talk free energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: free energy counters entropy free energy delays the inevitable free energy lets you go up hill free energies the building stuff Okay, at the end of the day, we have to come back down again it's temporary right so that that idea I came up with the other day, where you have the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's a sun earth and remember we do this energy chart right the energy goes down down as you get further away from the sun it gets colder But then when you get to earth, because we have the atmosphere there's a bump.\nAndrew Ippolito: A bump in the road is life.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do we just run number something yeah life.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what the bump is okay, so if you zoom into that.\nAndrew Ippolito: they're right here this this up hill that's the positive delta G that's the game in the free energy that lets us live Okay, but but look at where the story goes there is no other outcome to that because entropy is inevitable right so energy flows through the system.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can never have a situation where you're gaining free energy and entropy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now with the books, probably said there and what might have concern a confused you is whenever there is a change in free energy going up, there is another side that's going down.\nAndrew Ippolito: With the coupling right So if you think about it, your life as you walk through your life you're leaving a trail of destruction behind you.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right you eat a nice hamburger and it turns into poop.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean that's that's the energy continuum right, so you can go and have your life that hamburger doesn't have its life anymore.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, we have to we are evil wizards we suck that the force out of the good and we eat it so that we can live and I never thought of it that way, maybe, where the baddies.\nAndrew Ippolito: anybody here ever watch the dragon Prince.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah Okay, and so so Alexis number of the dragon prints we talked about that the humans get their power from from nature right the elves naturally have their power so they're the good guys they get their power from like the sun or the moon, the wind or whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: humans have to take like this beautiful butterfly and we have to suck the magic energy out of it, so we can do our spells right and like when you're hit with this in the show.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're like wow that's kind of like eating meat.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because, because the person is explaining this magic rule to you or you know, in the in the show doesn't seem to come across as a bad person.\nAndrew Ippolito: Until they take this beautiful butterfly and suck the life out of it and kill it so that they can cast a magic spell and you're thinking as the audience Member oh that's evil, and then you might think that's what I do with my food.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right what she has she doesn't have to cast a spell right but I mean they kind of do in order to compete with the rest of this stuff going on anyway dragon prints if you haven't seen that it's yeah it's a cartoon but it's amazing good storytelling good world building.\nAlexis Micewski: And if you watch Avatar the last airbender it's like the same creators, is that.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah oh I didn't realize that.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's the same authors.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are the same I don't as the author, the right word or I.\nAlexis Micewski: The writers I don't know.\nAlexis Micewski: Right yeah yeah there you go okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well that's good to know.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I guess that's Cora right isn't Cora another one of those.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a.\nAlexis Micewski: spin oh yes she's the sequel.\nAndrew Ippolito: hmm right, I never finished out the airbender stuff I watched the movie I know that it wasn't.\nAndrew Ippolito: It was terrible for those yeah yeah I know I thought it was Okay, but.\nAndrew Ippolito: But um yeah I love any system, you have that world building of the.\nAndrew Ippolito: magic like there's got to be like a suck not as like a science behind the magic to.\nAndrew Ippolito: catch my interest.\nJordan Russell: Is it correct me if i'm wrong, but it seems like the dragon prints on netflix isn't thought about like nasza.\nJordan Russell: Chinese folklore or am I thinking of something else.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know, maybe there, I mean most most.\nAndrew Ippolito: Modern stories.\nAndrew Ippolito: have a basis in some earlier myth, you know.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you can trace anything back to anything there's a saying in the writing world, and that is that every story is already been told.\nYou know it's just different spins on it and.\nAndrew Ippolito: And subverting the audience's expectations.\nJordan Russell: Okay yeah yeah i'm thinking of a different a different.\nJordan Russell: movie, this is a TV series.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah okay.\nJordan Russell: that's cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's part of the reason why I play D amp D I played under the dragons and i'm the DM and I get to make up the stories and it's so much fun.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so that's that that's the end of the term so Tyler did that um oh Eric what you want to drop class but it's extra okay so Eric wrote.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is the dragon Prince good, yes, it is very good, I highly highly highly recommend it it's one of those."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 8 - Special Topics -

episode over already we, why is this season over already we where's the next season it's like one of those it just keeps going the story, so good.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they schumer's pretty good too I yeah Okay, and then Tyler said.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I can say entropy.\nAndrew Ippolito: increases and an extra ganache reaction, because of the heat release from it.\nI have to think about that for a second.\nyeah.\nBecause of the heat.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah yeah you could so you could say that you could your brains definitely seeing this in a way, my brain does it and it's not wrong whatever you're doing keep doing it and I kind of hope, I get there at some point.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the heat being released right, so you start with a system with some energy in it and then something happens to that system, and now it has less energy right extra got it right, and so that that new state of the system with the lower energy that has a more entropy in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good good good and then the last thing you could say is just think about 10 things think about the very, very basic physical.\nAndrew Ippolito: characteristics of a system temperature pressure density right everything has temperature pressure and density interviews a measure of how far along it is where all those things become the same within the system.\nAndrew Ippolito: So if you measure, so you know the picture my screen as a system so by measure the temperature here is a picture were in whatever this beautiful setting is with the mountain in the background, and so, if I measure the temperature here.\nAndrew Ippolito: It would be colder than if I measured it here right so there's differences in the temperature and maybe the air is a little more dense here, compared to up here but someday you know, imagine all that being even.\nAndrew Ippolito: That would have more entropy so right now there's less entropy here, which makes sense because the sun's beating down on us all the time, and so the sun gives us energy to counter the chaos.\nOkay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, any last words any last questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, seeing as how there are none, I

Andrew Ippolito: We focused on the electromagnetic spectrum I taught you some of that. Andrew Ippolito: I that's what I skipped with them Okay, so let me give you this briefly what we're gonna do is we're gonna do a little art class here so so get your color pens and pencils out if you have them and we're going to draw the basics of what's let's call it a C three leaf.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and i'm going to go through this quick, because this is less important than the molecular mechanisms okay so i'll highlight the key points here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the first thing is is there's an epidemic like a skin right that's the top and the epidermis is coded by a waxy cuticle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and none of us photosynthetic so its way to the bottom of the leaf same thing same deal epidermis but let's we're just gonna draw one hole in it right here like that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is called the there's the stoma sometimes it's called a stone meet and the plural is the Mata what's the model you.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah that's my Italian actually coming through I don't have an Italian accent but i'm half Italian. Andrew Ippolito: And every time I see the worst tomato I have to say it with that kind of New York City the model Okay, the stone meat is surrounded by a pair of cells called guard cells and they are green because they're photosynthetic okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: The guard cells can swell shut or contract using us Moses, to open and close think of this like the plants mouth Okay, and the bottom of belief, has hundreds and hundreds of these things, maybe thousands.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this whole thing is technically called. Andrew Ippolito: This tomato complex, I think, and the whole itself is called the aperture.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then the cells themselves again, those are guard cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right now, let me get myself a little more room here i'm just going to bring this up a little bit like that, and the core of a plant has a lot of."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Photosynthesis Lecture: Gas Exchange and Stomata","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito explains the process of gas exchange in plants and the role of stomata in facilitating this exchange.

Andrew Ippolito: Okay now let's talk about gas exchange so i'm going to scroll down here so here I wanna I want to say pause the video here if you're watching this so you can get the rest of that, but really this if you go over the PowerPoint now.\nAndrew Ippolito: You go right here, all this is here Okay, the difference between this more detailed anatomy on the right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what I want you to know is, you don't have to worry about the difference between the palisade layer the spongy just understand the middle of the leaf is called.\nAndrew Ippolito: Perfect well you don't even have to prank you just have to know the mass of fuel cell this this word right here that's the key just just know where it happens i've never going to quiz you on the internal anatomy here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, when you're looking at a real microscope slide here let's just take a quick look at this you'll see there's the epidermis you see it's clear.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the clearness of It means that there's no pigments in it. Andrew Ippolito: you'll notice that there's a mess of fuel cells taking up the vast majority of the middle here and it's punky layer\nAndrew Ippolito: And you'll see here the bundle sheet cells BSC surrounding the vascular bundle right and, by the way, you've probably seen these words when you were kids die alone and slow them right and that's we're not going into that either this is bio to stuff when you learn plant physiology.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then you have let's see. Andrew Ippolito: there's no really good.\nAndrew Ippolito: This isn't really a stalemate i'm trying to see if there you can kind of imagine now there's no this this slide doesn't have a there's no good view of this domain there.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then anyway, and then the C four plan notice has the dark dark green bottle sheet cells surrounding the vascular bundle and then you have the spongy layer around it Okay, the key was see for plants we'll talk about later, is that they are isolated from the environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, they they don't directly participate in the gas exchange they're hiding there they're really there it's being sequestered so that outside changes in."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Photosynthesis Lecture: Light Reactions","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito introduces the concept of light reactions in photosynthesis.

Andrew Ippolito: I want you to think now think of the game, think of a logical. Angela Harbeck: consequence to that.\nAndrew Ippolito: The conduct the concentrate. Andrew Ippolito: Inside the cell is always going to be lower than outside the cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, this flow of carbon dioxide is governed by simple diffusion.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and contrast. Andrew Ippolito: During the light reactions oxygens produced.\nAndrew Ippolito: audio issues here for no reason just. No reason.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's just unstable that's, the problem is this. This bluetooth connection is unstable.\nAndrew Ippolito: I mean just shut off a. couple things here.\nalright. Andrew Ippolito: sorry about that alright so oxygen oxygen is produced inside the leaf, so the concentrations tend to be higher.\nAndrew Ippolito: than outside and I see a chat message. Andrew Ippolito: or stoma on the bottom, yes, yes that's that's what makes the.\nAndrew Ippolito: underneath part of a leaf fundamentally different if you ever held a leaf before which everybody hopefully has held belief, and you know held belief and looked at it before the top is waxy and shiny knows the bottom is usually not.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you take an oak leaf or a maple leaf or or just you know, a spruce tree or ash tree just take any leaf and you'll notice the bottom is not smooth and silky that's where all the breathing Okay, the top is where it's being directly by the sun and so it's hot, and so, if the water.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, if i'm. Andrew Ippolito: If the waxing cuticle wasn't there trapping it all in the water, would be about rating right.\nAndrew Ippolito: But let's so let's go through here, so they oxygen right because the concentration inside the leaf is higher it's going to diffuse out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so this right here, this is the basics of the gap, we just called gas exchange.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm dealing with. Andrew Ippolito: Our technical issues today, and then I really want to right now.\njust trying to me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like tori I just thought wow. What kind of bird is that.\nVictoria Bloemker: I have no clue. Andrew Ippolito: yeah I know. Victoria Bloemker: yeah. Andrew Ippolito: Really never seen that kind of burden it looks like a would, I think it's a woodpecker based on its peak.\nAndrew Ippolito: i've never seen a car splotchy. Andrew Ippolito: feather pattern that is really cool. Victoria Bloemker: It go through my.\nAndrew Ippolito: Fire party anyway it's okay you're gonna go bring it to the refuge or something or you just did just let it go outside yeah.\nOkay it's not moving it. Andrew Ippolito: was just confused.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So what we're going to see later.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is i'm. Andrew Ippolito: On a hot day okay i'm just gonna cut to the chase here rather than spending 10 minutes talking about this i'm just going to give you the bottom line here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Imagine what would happen if the guard cell swelled up and shut, which is what happens on a hot day oh that's what water, but just think of water right water.\nAndrew Ippolito: necessarily because there's a hole there water is going to evaporate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Just like when you're walking around with your mouth open. Andrew Ippolito: you're going to be losing water you're always losing water out of your mouth, if you ever go hiking.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like intense hiking out in the woods for days, if you ever do backpacking or camping and you're trying to conserve your own water supply.\nAndrew Ippolito: You breathe, through your nose, they say you breathe, through your mouth and and out. Andrew Ippolito: You know which, if you're not if you're a little out of shape and you're you know walking fast in the woods, with a heavy backpack on your breathing through your mouth.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're going to lose a lot of water fast plants do the same thing Okay, this is actually how plants drink, if you think about a tree.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here, this is, this is a tree. Andrew Ippolito: And here's the branch, and you think about the leaf on the tip of that branch, and the idea that the water is leaving.\nAndrew Ippolito: At the base of the truth of the leaf right that creates a vacuum pressure there is basically the vasculature goes, all the way down from the leaf through the branches, all the way down and then actually let's do into the roots.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, where the roots, then, are hopefully in soil that has water in it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that it's like a one big crazy strong number when you were a kid you have a crazy straws and you can watch the water go through all the little loops in circles, if ever anybody have a crazy straw.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I still have this okay yeah we have the craziest dress so that they can be crazy stuff Okay, except in semi person at the top drinking from it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay there's a vacuum being caused by this evaporation, and so the whole vasculature pulls the water out of the soil that's how plants drink.\nAndrew Ippolito: This only happens obviously when there's leaves on the trees right which is going to be happening very, very soon.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this is the period of the, this is the Tommy year where, if you have to treat your tree with chemicals to prevent it from being destroyed by like the Emerald ash borer which, if you noticed our region is being invaded by anybody here and deal with the Emerald ash borer yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you have asteroids on your property anybody have dead ash trees, on your property.\nAndrew Ippolito: Nobody you guys are all lucky enough to deal with this crap my whole backyard is basically a graveyard of dead ash and it's because of this, and be some species, so the ones, close to the House, we protected by giving them some kind of chemical that kills the ash borer.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in the time of year to do that is coming up where the once once the leaf start blooming the tree starts drinking.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay alright so on a hot day now let's think about mid summer on a hot day what happens is.\nAndrew Ippolito: The guard cell swash up. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, carbon dioxide can't get in oxygen can't get up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so think now here about the relative rates of concentration changes here.\nAndrew Ippolito: oxygen levels are going to go up inside the cell or the leaf and carbon dioxide levels are going to go down right because.\nAndrew Ippolito: The carbon F, is still being used to me sugars and so that level is going to go down, but you can't get new and then the oxygen level they're still gonna climb Okay, and so as we'll see in the first step of the Calvin cycle there's this enzyme called rubbish.\nAndrew Ippolito: rubbish called normally does this take carbon dioxide and this five carbon molecule called RU BP."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Photosynthesis Lecture: Calvin Cycle","chunkSummary":"Professor Ippolito discusses the Calvin cycle, which is the second stage of photosynthesis.

Andrew Ippolito: And the carbon dioxide levels drop rubbish go starts instead to use oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: In a process called photo respiration you respond we do respiration we breathe oxygen and we read the carbon dioxide out well now the plants doing that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because the byproduct of that let's keep drawing this and read here so photo respiration photo respiration takes are you BP and oxygen and instead it creates carbon dioxide, but the key is is it permanently.\npermanently. Andrew Ippolito: destroys. Andrew Ippolito: The rsvp.\nAndrew Ippolito: That five carbon molecule it's not a cycle Okay, and so, over time, the plant will lose it all, and then die so photo respiration This is very bad.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this would happens in the summertime to see three plants. Andrew Ippolito: and see for plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: have figured out a way to prevent this from happening in a way that will talk about at the end of the lecture.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, any questions so far so oxygen is oxidized and carbon dioxide is reduced, you know opposite opposite here, this is how so here if we're doing redux stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay here's here's so here's the equation we're going to deal with today we're going to take that whoops let's use happy colors here we use carbon dioxide we're going to take six miles because of carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to take six molecules of water.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to go through an incredibly complex system that's going to culminate in giving us one molecule of six 812 oh six.\nAndrew Ippolito: And oxygen. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, as far as the redux goes, you can imagine the carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: is being reduced.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the water. Andrew Ippolito: is being.\nAndrew Ippolito: oxidized.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So when I say reduced. Andrew Ippolito: Think looks track the hydrogens see the hydrogens.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're taking the hydrogens from water so. Andrew Ippolito: You can think of, you are oxidizing water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so track the hydrogens that's what the proton that's where the electrons are gonna be alright guys What was your question.\nAngela Harbeck: um so when the guard cells like swell up and stuff how do things get into the cell then.\nAngela Harbeck: Like other materials that the so leads the plan so. Andrew Ippolito: So.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, like. Andrew Ippolito: All the stuff or just covered doesn't. Angela Harbeck: know, like all this stuff.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now that's a great question, so the cells within the leaf if we zoom out here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Actually let's look at PowerPoint for a second okay so. Andrew Ippolito: The bundle see cells and i'm sorry the vasculature right here there's the stuff in here there's design them in the flow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay they're basically they're dedicated tubes and forgive me, I have this Nice.\nAndrew Ippolito: I tell I always. Andrew Ippolito: If I see, I have this nice I don't sneeze and then I trust I just see if that up too late.\nAndrew Ippolito: Late yeah now you know what that's genetic it turns out. Andrew Ippolito: Some people can do that, and some people can't.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you can yeah if you can, if you're about to sneeze and you look up at the sun and you sneeze that's that ability to do that and turns out to be genetic.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the people who can't do that i've tried i'm one of those unlucky souls who stares at the sun and just get blinded.\nAndrew Ippolito: raise your hand if you can look at a light it's force yourself to sneeze besides April okay good Julia in April and Sammy are you guys rather right next to each other on my screen to that's kind of funny.\nSami Jordan: yeah I learned that it was because realize we're more sensitive. Andrew Ippolito: yeah no it's.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's there's there's some circuitry in there. Andrew Ippolito: That, I have no idea how it works, but some people are wired that way and some aren't and its genetic it's a recessive trait.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is why there's only three of you, but then. Andrew Ippolito: we'll revisit this when we do genetics leader that's not important right now what's important is this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so. Andrew Ippolito: So Angela fans here we. Andrew Ippolito: Do it. Julia Lakchin: No, but a lot of the times when i've just needs, and I feel it's not coming out I just quickly turn on my flashlight and just like wine.\nJulia Lakchin: bow. Andrew Ippolito: And it makes me go out. Andrew Ippolito: Just a flashlight does it. yeah.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah not me. Andrew Ippolito: I just right now, I just have a reservoir of and even worse than us later it's like an investment in pain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so Angela answer your question the the nutrients right the all the magnesium chloride and proteins and look at whatever.\nAndrew Ippolito: To get the plants healthy they're all being transported up there by those items in the fall so desire them if I always get these backwards, but one of them.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, is water with sides in it kind of like your blood plasma and then the other is sugars and large molecules like that's what SAP is okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, so the carbon Alex it's coming in and then all the other nutrients are being manufactured inside the cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: That help. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, what what's the part in particular that's itching your your thoughts here.\nAngela Harbeck: As you said, carbon dioxide can't get in. Andrew Ippolito: OK OK, so the key there is.\nAndrew Ippolito: It used to be able to get in. Andrew Ippolito: And now it can't right so so the it's kind of you holding your breath imagine if I asked you to hold your breath right you now you can't breathe oxygen in any more.\nAndrew Ippolito: But you're using the oxygen that was in there until you start feeling stressed right because the levels of it are going down as you use it same thing with this Okay, and it does eventually die, just like you would.\nAndrew Ippolito: right but it just like anybody would, if they hold their breath what the if you all your breath too long you've actually just pass out and you start reading it right, but the idea is is, you have a very acute need for oxygen right, we all need to be breathing oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: and which takes about just like three or four minutes that's how fast we're using it right and so when we do so respiration will see the use of oxygen at the bottom of the transport electron transport chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: The turnover rate of using our ATP so fast, is why we need to be breathing in Austria constantly.\nAndrew Ippolito: plants are a little different they're a little slower they don't have the same physiology we do, and so they can hold their breath for a couple days right, but they will eventually if you receive brown grass in the summertime that's because they're holding their breath too long okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: When the leaves die, but the other parts don't they could just go dorman the soil.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, good question. Andrew Ippolito: Alright, so let's skip here now, now that you understand the basics of that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here that I literally just wrote this on the whiteboard but there it is again right, so the idea of this is to have reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so. Andrew Ippolito: it's way more complicated than we thought when we first started pulling us apart, it always is.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what we're going to do, you can just use a slide later for tracking the atoms we used to think that the oxygen that's released.\nAndrew Ippolito: came from the carbon dioxide, I mean if you think about it, CO2 just rip the carbon off of it go make some sugars and then release this that makes sense, but that's not what happens at all, it turns out the oxygen comes from the water.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that this entire thing gets used up as part of the sugars as well see.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: alright. Andrew Ippolito: So we're going to do a quick overview now the molecular mechanisms, here we got the light reactions and we have the Calvin cycle, because the light dependent reactions, you can see light reactions they're dependent on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like the Calvin cycle is not dependent on light, so we can sometimes refer to those light independent reactions, we generally don't talk about them as the dark reactions, the reason being they don't require dark great.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so what happens in the light reactions is we're going to basically take water and we're going to break it we're going to rip the electrons out.\nAndrew Ippolito: bless you I see you sneaking out Okay, where we're going to rip the electrons off of that and we're going to put those electrons to use to make sure.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay we're going to take this thing here this any dp plus molecule think of this molecule as a hot plate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all the job is already we're gonna see a bunch of these today we're going to see any dp.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna see any D, but not today but later we're going to see these three guys okay any dp and ED F ED Okay, we just think of us as electron carriers.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are taxi cabs that shuttle energy from one point to another point physically without it just being lost to the air.\nAndrew Ippolito: Imagine taking a glass of water, putting it in the microwave turning them off for five minutes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, after that you have this rolling boiling water, you can pick that up out of the microwave and you can walk over to the other room.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know, make tea whatever, but the idea, there is you've captured energy from the microwaves into the water and now it's in the water, and you can transport that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, as opposed to if you just turn the microwave on with nothing in it after five minutes you open the door it's just there's nothing there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so what these things do is let the cell capture some energy there's some process and then move it Okay, these things are.\nAndrew Ippolito: These molecules are like think of them like steel they're really, really strong molecules they're not going to blow up if they get handed a bunch of high energy electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so so that's another concept, you can get in your head now is this idea of a high energy electron, which is a very dangerous thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: And there are some molecules that once you touch that molecule the high energy electron boom it's just going to fragment whereas other molecules can hold it.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think of it, like the infinity gauntlet from the marvel movies. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, you put the infinity gauntlet on and you're just a human you're going to probably die pretty quickly, but if you're Santos, you can you know hold it for a little while you still gonna blow up eventually.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can just hold it for a while. Andrew Ippolito: There he goes with the movie references again all right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, the goal of light reactions, the goal of light reactions pump energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: into.\nAndrew Ippolito: Chemical bonds. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the, this is the whole capture the energy from the sun and trapped in chemical bonds and then the Calvin cycle is use that.\nAndrew Ippolito: reserve energy. Andrew Ippolito: To make.\nAndrew Ippolito: Complex. Andrew Ippolito: Organic molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: organic market right i'm trying to avoid high energy low energy like the idea, there is you right remember that we're building card castles we're building very, very complex molecules from very simple molecules and you have to go uphill to do that."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Introduction to Photosynthesis","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of photosynthesis and its importance in converting sunlight into energy for plants.

Andrew Ippolito: So, so the reason why the colors of the leaves change in the autumn i'll tell it to you is that, as it gets colder and darker.\nAndrew Ippolito: The plant stops producing new pigments and it turns out that chlorophyll a the predominant one is much more energetic and therefore unstable go back to your entropy idea.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's a card Castle rate chlorophyll is a high energy molecule it's capable of holding a lot of energy it's going to be the first to go.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, as chlorophyll a breaks down quickly the carotenoids take much longer to break down they linger and so, once all the green goes, then you start to see the other colors coming out of the noise it's the same reason why Imagine you had in your in your room.\nAndrew Ippolito: You had. Andrew Ippolito: a red light. Andrew Ippolito: And you just imagine had a little crystal ball that was colored read it was it was glowing red, but the rest of your room was white light and so anybody just passing by the room would say that the color of the light coming out of that room is white.\nAndrew Ippolito: But as you turn the white light down and then realize the only one there now the room threat.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so there's not as many carotenoids is there other chlorophyll but, once the chlorophyll is go away, the only thing you're going to see is the crowds.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, that makes sense. Andrew Ippolito: Okay alright so that's the absorption spectrum and ashen spectrum, this is a completely different experiments okay so here's we would do this in the lab if we could all right, so you could take a test tube."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Light Reactions and Calvin Cycle","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito describes the spatial organization of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle in photosynthesis. He explains that the light reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane, where pigments capture light energy and generate ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle, on the other hand, takes place in the stroma, where carbon dioxide is converted into sugars using the energy from ATP and NADPH.","start":"50:56","end":"1:03:49","content":"Andrew Ippolito: and fill it with a leaf or there's a plant called elodia.\nAndrew Ippolito: hello, Dr it's a fresh water plant that grows in lakes all around us.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, take ella do and then put a Cork in it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And shine different colors of light on it at a given time and then what you're going to do is you go into one of those leaves you can just visualize this if this is a leaf.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you look at the bottom of the leaf, you would notice little bubbles of oxygen gas collecting.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the oxygen being pushed out of the stalemate in response to the photosynthesis, and so what you would do is you would just count the number of bubbles per leaf and get a number.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that correlates to the rate of photosynthesis. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so what you do you look back here now at the actual spectrum you'll notice that say at about I don't know what is this 420 ish is this peak and there's another peak here at about 680.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the peak at which the the amount of oxygen is maximized Okay, so, if you look at these two very quickly you'll notice that, if you take the absorption spectrum and average it out, you essentially get the actual spectrum.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so this is one of those. Andrew Ippolito: correlations and science that allow us to then dig deeper and learn the mechanisms, this is a correlation is not causation and the very first experiment that did this, this was brilliant take.\nAndrew Ippolito: A prism of light or take a take a prism of courts, let me see if I can draw this hold on.\nAndrew Ippolito: Take a prism. Andrew Ippolito: put it on the windowsill.\nAndrew Ippolito: And right next to it. Andrew Ippolito: Put a petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: and fill it. Andrew Ippolito: With bacteria cyanobacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then shine the light down on it. Andrew Ippolito: So here's sunlight.\nAndrew Ippolito: And of course the sunlight because it's a prism it breaks it.\nAndrew Ippolito: I didn't draw this particularly accurately, but you can imagine me see how this would work, this would be red light.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's would be orange. Andrew Ippolito: This would be yellow.\nGreen. blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: And purple right so that's how the light would just kind of lay out that way on the petri dish.\nAndrew Ippolito: and Andrew Ippolito: let's say that we let's say that we put the bag let's see how the bacteria, have to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's use. Andrew Ippolito: let's use I guess green.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's the bacteria growing let's say let's say we started it here and it turns out.\nAndrew Ippolito: It would literally grow. Andrew Ippolito: into what's essentially.\nAndrew Ippolito: A chart a histogram so here, if you look that.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the this was done back in 1883 in Germany. Andrew Ippolito: This is increments experiment.\nAndrew Ippolito: He basically created a living line line graph. Andrew Ippolito: So those are bacteria, those are cyanobacteria.\nAndrew Ippolito: Growing neuro filament of algae. Andrew Ippolito: On a prism and so you can see that in the purples and the blues and again in the reds they like those colors.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: First single music soon. Andrew Ippolito: yeah go ahead.\nJulia Lakchin: So, have you ever seen like like no parking lot for example and oil get.\nJulia Lakchin: On the floor as i'm like that color, why is that. Andrew Ippolito: So that's called.\nAndrew Ippolito: iridescence and what iridescence is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Is if you have you here let's say that this is a like a wall of water let's just say they're here, let me use that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here you're in the parking lot right and so there's you know there's nooks and crannies in the parking lot here's another in a in the parking lot and then it rains right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we get some water here, so this is all water all right, and then there's there's oil everywhere, because you're in a parking lot Ray the tar actually what happens is is the the asphalt itself leeches oils it's that's not.\nAndrew Ippolito: Somebody having an oil spill over that happens to but naturally asphalt will leach oil that especially a new paved road they will leach the oils out, and so what happens is, if you like, imagine zooming into this.\nAndrew Ippolito: The oil slick on the surface. Andrew Ippolito: is not an even thickness okay so there's there's varying thickness here.\nRight. Andrew Ippolito: And so, as the light passes through here this acts like a prism but it's not like the typical prism you think of like this it's a prism that has.\nAndrew Ippolito: Different thicknesses and so that, depending on the thickness of the prism whether it's here, this is going to give off certain wavelengths of light versus this part here, which is going to give up different wavelengths of light so you're going to start to see rainbow.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know all sorts of different colors there and it's due to the it's very thin but differing in thicknesses throughout it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what gives you that beautiful iridescence This is also why butterfly wings have that kind of shimmer to it that's it's called iridescence and the idea is is that it acts like a prism being super duper thin and not evenly not even thickness.\nAndrew Ippolito: you'll learn that when you take physics you learn the details there okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, don't worry about the details of this anymore, I want to skip ahead now. Andrew Ippolito: yeah okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here, so the idea here is that when a pigment absorbs light it goes from a ground state to an excited state the electron does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, remember that we have this idea of energy shells and the electron goes up and energy Shell, or sometimes it goes up to energy shells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and then it'll fall back down again. Andrew Ippolito: called quantum leap.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, when the high energy electron falls back down in that process it releases light.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is the concept called fluorescence flower essences when you have a molecule a pigment that can gain the light and then it gives it back again.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it always gives it back into lower energy because of the second law of thermodynamics so it comes in, as say blue light and then it leaves us a green light.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why you're going to drag toys or old green. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so the idea here is, if we have an entire test tube filler a beaker here in our own Meyer flask filled with an extract of chlorophyll you shine a black light on it, you will see a glow.\nAndrew Ippolito: Plants don't do this because they're doing something useful with the energy this thing has just given it off right wouldn't it be kind of Nice to just have a test tube and shine a light on it now they have some sugar water right that's not how it works that'd be nice, though.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so what plants do is they take this physics, they take this physics of here's a pigment we absorb some light and me give it off again Okay, and they use that to their advantage.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the engine we have this engineered system this highly complex system we're going to put these chlorophyll molecules that and then these crowd noise.\nAndrew Ippolito: and mass with the photo system is the proteins align the pigments and these beautiful ways to create this think of it like like a machine.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So we have what's called here's the beginning of the molecular mechanism, now we have what's called a photo system, a photo system is a complex that is made out of both proteins and organic molecules that include pigments okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so at the core of the photo system, the important part, the nexus of it is called the reaction Center and the reaction Center always holds a pair of chlorophyll a's.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they are usually aligned right next to another molecule we're just going to call the primary electron acceptor.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so I want to skip to here, so you can see that, right here so here's i'll tell you what let me, let me do this first ready here's context here's a plan cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: With a central back you'll and it's chloroplasts we're going to zoom into the chloroplasts now here's the chloroplasts there's the outer membrane here's the inner membrane and then we're going to just take one silo quite right now for simplicity here's one silo quite.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, this here is the thigh liquid membrane.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this here is the liquid space. Andrew Ippolito: And this is where the light reactions will take place in particular the light reaction will take place on memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then this region of space here does anybody remember what this is called.\nAndrew Ippolito: straw man good. Andrew Ippolito: that's the straw ma not confused don't confuse that with doma, which is why it's Nice we use the word still meet right remember those are the portion the leaf okay we're not talking about that, so the simplest way to think of this is the light reactions happen here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the Calvin cycle happens here. Andrew Ippolito: We have to physical place so that's why this is a very visual system, you can do this when you learn this stuff I very, very strongly recommend that you draw this out and put things in space.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's the liquid. Andrew Ippolito: that's the membrane of the liquid.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is photo system to the called PS to like playstation two.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what we're that's our key story here, so the reaction Center you can think of as of right in the bottom there and the primary electronic structure would be like right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the idea is. Andrew Ippolito: Is the chlorophyll is arranged and the carotenoids they're all arranged in these these lattices around the reaction Center okay here's a visual imagine you're out in the desert and there's this huge black obelisk jutting out of the sand.\nAndrew Ippolito: And surrounding that obelisk so here let's see if we can visualize this here's this big black obelisk in the desert.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and surrounding it on all sides are mirrors and the mirrors are angled in such a way.\nAndrew Ippolito: Such that when the sun shines down on any mirror it bounces the light into the black obelisk.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, any one mirror by itself isn't going to contribute too much.\nAndrew Ippolito: But all the mirrors at the same time shining all their light on that black obelisk is going to make that black gobble is so hot that it can take sodium chloride, and make it liquid.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we can pump that sodium chloride and drive some steam engines.\nAndrew Ippolito: Some steam turbines and we can generate electricity that's how we use solar power out in the desert.\nAndrew Ippolito: right we basically stole a page out of the plants playbook."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Introduction","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito introduces the topic of photosynthesis and explains the importance of understanding the process.","start":"0:00","end":"0:45","content":"Andrew Ippolito: This is the second lecture on photosynthesis today we're going to go through the the meat of it all the complex mechanisms and some of the context here so i'm going to skip through the slides we already talked about the other day.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to arrive here at the wall so just quick review we talked about the leaf anatomy of a C three plant.\nAndrew Ippolito: The idea of the the key here being that photosynthesis occurs in only the mass of fuel cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right that's the middle layer muscle means middle and phil means so so we're I think it means tissue actually.\nTaylor Campbell: i'm not gonna sit here we didn't really get into any of this.

Andrew Ippolito: On the left side of the screen there, so now we're going this way to this, the Calvin cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a toothpick. Andrew Ippolito: Still.\nAll right. Andrew Ippolito: Sometimes the Calvin cycle is called the try car bought.\nAndrew Ippolito: cycle or TC a So if you watch the video on the Internet, and this is the TC a cycle it's the same thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: Sometimes it might be referred to as the light independent.\nAndrew Ippolito: reactions. Andrew Ippolito: And then there's a misnomer, you might see a called the dark reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: And again, the reason why we don't really call it, that is because it doesn't require dark.\nAndrew Ippolito: The light reactions require like.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, before we begin other any questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, are you guys still able to absorb. Andrew Ippolito: This is, I know this is a lot and one day right, so the good news is is you have it's Wednesday, and you have spring break next week.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so you're going to forget all this now. Andrew Ippolito: it's like we never even had this lecture you had gonna have no memory of this conversation.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now, what I want you to do over spring break, as I do want you to relax I want you to take a few days yourself, I want you to go outside of starting to get nice out.\nAndrew Ippolito: get some more exercise right do some spring cleaning do some fun social stuff watch some good movie maybe binge watch, one of the shows we've talked about a firefly that's a good one.\nAndrew Ippolito: or but but, but what I want you to do is this here, if I had to give you any advice on like how to maintain the academic stuff if this is the week you got Sunday Wednesday and Sunday.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do something during those days to keep this fresh okay here's what I find, in my experience.\nAndrew Ippolito: After spring break there's like a fork in the road some students, they just they just ignored everything they thought it was like summer vacation and then that Monday is just pure pain for them.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that some of them just never recover from that. Andrew Ippolito: They just lost, they just lost.\nAndrew Ippolito: All the everything fell out of their brains. Andrew Ippolito: Right and those are generally the ones that have the busy life, to begin with, in the multiple classes and the full time job and the kids and like just so they're like oh yeah I remember long ago I was taking biology.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's like a week ago, but it feels like a lifetime Okay, so my recommendation is spring break is a break.\nAndrew Ippolito: But it's like it's like our breaks during the class they're they're not really meant to you're not resetting yourself you're rejuvenating so keep your head in the game during spring break as best you can okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm not telling you to study every day I don't want you doing that I want you to take a break, we all need it we're all a little burned out Okay, because after spring break it's just a straight run.\nAndrew Ippolito: To the end of the Semester okay so take a few days for yourself but don't take all the days okay if you're behind on things if you feel like you're just always behind i've had a lot of students, where they take spring break to catch up and so that Monday, they feel great.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because they put the work in during the week relaxing versions of work where there's no timeline they they just they have a whole seven days to catch up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right that's all syllabus rubric. Andrew Ippolito: Calvin cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the first thing is in your head you're like that the library actions are easy in part because there's a place for them to live in your head, you have that membrane you have that Nice linear it's a picture in your head of a rectangle with some stuff on it.\nAndrew Ippolito: For the straumur you're like these things are just all floating around in 3D space.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so one useful thing to do is to maybe and I don't know honestly I don't know exactly how it's setup but if I had to guess.\nAndrew Ippolito: There probably is some kind of physical orientation and organization to this, I don't think it's just a bunch of random collisions and space.\nAndrew Ippolito: I don't know if there's a scaffolding I don't know if there's a filament layer in there that it's all arranged on like a spider web of enzymes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Maybe somebody knows I don't and i've never been interested enough at this point, until just this moment to look into this maybe i'll do that, after class.\nAndrew Ippolito: So what you can do is, however, you want to do it Okay, whatever works best for you to put it in space, so what I want to do is i'm going to give you the players and i'm going to put it, the way I understand it Okay, and so it all starts with carbon dioxide it's all money is a really big.\nAndrew Ippolito: Big in red boom that's CO2. Andrew Ippolito: carrots hey Let me set my pens up here i'll do read and that's big, and this will be my normal white.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I can draw things normal and then we'll use on.\nAndrew Ippolito: One is orange. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to use blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like a dark blue.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so the way i'm going to do this is red represents and Ashley Ashley so i'll make carbon dioxide if sorry if you're using colors already.\nAndrew Ippolito: i'm going to use dark blue here the blue represents low energy stable molecules red represents high energy right so carbon dioxide is is blues you get.\nAndrew Ippolito: That CO2. All right.\nAndrew Ippolito: There are some molecule that's less you know not super high energy but it's got some 12345 there's a five carbon molecule and its name is right below this number rainbows that's ridiculous that's a that's a penthouse sugar romulus.\nAndrew Ippolito: This philosophy. Andrew Ippolito: This just usually means there's two things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Why is it not die phosphate I don't know. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, we can, yes, the aipac committee.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is a five carbon molecule one carbon molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: In the very first chemical reaction, this is an enzymatic pathways man this all metabolism so there's enzymes involved there's an enzyme called i'm going to write out his full name first so you can understand what he does his name is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well before you give me the enzymes name, let me abbreviate romulus bisphosphonate for you this is usually how we write it capital are lowercase you for romulus and then capital B capital P, so you say, are you BP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, are you BP is the sugar that's involved in the Calvin cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the first reaction takes this RU BP.\nAndrew Ippolito: And a carbon dioxide. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so the enzyme that mediates this is appropriately named, are you BP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Car box soliz. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so car box ELISE is something that takes carbon dioxide and attaches it kind of like functional group so rsvp car box ELISE slash.\nAndrew Ippolito: oxygen as. Andrew Ippolito: Which remember we told you earlier, that sometimes.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to use oxygen instead, which is bad i'm just going to annotate that temporarily there so but that's why it's got that a full name it's both a car box least an oxygenated so that's why we abbreviate this ready.\nAndrew Ippolito: rubbish go. Andrew Ippolito: that's the name of the enzyme it's like nabisco remember the key blur elves instead and they make sugar to they use sugar to make cookies rubbish go is a helper in the process to like an Elf so there's the fiscal health.\nAndrew Ippolito: rubbish go Okay, now it used to be. Andrew Ippolito: You might see this some places on the Internet or in other people's notes.\nAndrew Ippolito: might look something like that. Andrew Ippolito: Right, the slash there correspond to the car box at least slash oxygen pace you generally won't see it that way, but, just in case right, this is an acronym this isn't a word.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay it's not even an acronym I forgot the fancy there's a word that I don't know in English, that means a word that is like redux redux another one of these things right redux isn't an acronym either right it's just taking words and taking piece of the words and mashing them together.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right rubbish go and read Dr those kinds of things and I don't even know what those are called they're not abbreviations are not acronyms there's a special English word at night.\nAndrew Ippolito: And my wife's English literature teacher, so I should know this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well that's like saying my dad's a doctor that's great that's me you're a doctor. Andrew Ippolito: My dad's a doctor, I know this like now your dad knows it.\nAndrew Ippolito: My wife knows that I did. Andrew Ippolito: Maybe she doesn't either who knows i'll ask earlier alright.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we have an enzyme named rubbish go, and so let me move all this now and make it Nice and clean i'm just going to take all this here there's going to move that over there and here's what we're going to do let's see that obispo is, will you will do enzymes in yellow here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's her best go.\nAndrew Ippolito: What rabbinical is going to do is take that carbon dioxide and take that rsvp.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's going to set off a chain of events. Andrew Ippolito: A series of unfortunate events no it's not, unfortunately, these are good events, a series of events ready and i'm not going to give you the details of this we're going to go from the five carbon 12345 plus the one carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're immediately going to pump this full of energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: From. Andrew Ippolito: The na the pH.\nAndrew Ippolito: ATP alright so we're not going to worry about the mechanisms here we're just going to understand we're going to take this and through a series of chemical reactions we're going to pump this molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: filled with energy so we're going to it's going to break in half, because it's not strong enough to hold all this energy Okay, and so it snaps in half.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so now i'm going to draw these and read these are these are high energy molecules now 123123.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so again, these are a series of reactions here we're glossing over it in your book, you will see this ready, you will see.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are you BP. Andrew Ippolito: Plus CO2. Andrew Ippolito: And then you get two molecules or something called this Fausto commiserate bbg.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's what the ATP coming in, and then you will see something called.\nAndrew Ippolito: glass around to hide three phosphate and that's what this is.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Regeneration of RuBP","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the final phase of the Calvin cycle, which involves the regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) using ATP.","start":"1:54:27","end":"2:02:57","content":"Andrew Ippolito: OK.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now so far that's just a metabolic pathway right that's just going this way but we're calling this a cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's the TC cycle, the Calvin cycle cycle start where they begin that's not where we began right we have these 200 molecules so what what's going on here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it turns out this this Calvin cycle has three phases to it and we've seen two of them, so far, so let's let's name us now ready let's use let's use some highlighters here let's do yellow here, so this right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This idea well really this right here, the idea of taking carbon dioxide, which is a gas and it's part of the a biotic environment and planting it into the biosphere This is called this concept is called fixation Okay, and so, in particular, you would say phase one is called carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: fixation. Andrew Ippolito: The idea of taking the gas and planting it into a solid.\nAndrew Ippolito: That not just any solid, though, like in the biosphere within a cell becomes a bio molecule so really you can think of it as going from the a biotic to the biotic.\nAndrew Ippolito: And plants do this oh photo synthesizers do this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now that we've got carbon. Andrew Ippolito: captured the second thing we're going to do to it is we're going to public full of energy, and so the second step is called carbon.\nAndrew Ippolito: reduction. Andrew Ippolito: That makes sense because we remember that reduction as the gain of electrons and, in this case, high energy electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now we can reason, are we to step three here ready let's think about that first chemical reaction for a second let's look at carbon account, we started out with one carbon here.\nAndrew Ippolito: And five carbons here right. Andrew Ippolito: And we got a six carbon intermediate.\nAndrew Ippolito: That broke down into two three carbon molecules right so so simply if I was to just diagram all that out very simply, here we have one carbon plus 12345 that's what went in.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we have these two right here, right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the question is how do we get back to the beginning, well, we can't by doing this, just once.\nAndrew Ippolito: What if we did all this, a second time so watch this if I take all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I repeat that process of fixation and reduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I repeat that process, one more time. Andrew Ippolito: fixation and reduction, so now i've done it three times.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, in other words, I have taken 123 molecules of carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: and make this little smaller just for the cartoony see here 1-234-512-3451 234 or five Okay, and then i've created 1-231-231-2312 3123123 there i've created a total here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have 123456 molecules of GDP.\nAndrew Ippolito: These are super duper high in energy lots and lots of free energy in that system, those are super advanced card castles.\nAndrew Ippolito: With moving parts and everything, those are those are is this is how you get what I want you to see this molecule here, as this red hot glowing rod that forges all organic molecules of life, this is where it starts.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is the pig iron super red molten we're going to make all of our good stuff out of this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, now, the first thing we have to do to take care of anything is take care of ourselves right, and so we have to use all the six here.\nAndrew Ippolito: We have to pay back the system so that I can keep going it's like having to pay a tax which is no fun so watch this let's think about this, how many we used up so far, we used up 123 carbon dioxide's right we used up 123 are you bps.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay let's just think of how many carbons are in there for a second there are these are these are five carbons each right so that's 15 carbons and then the three carbons so that's a total of 18 carbons right.\nAndrew Ippolito: On the left hand side here how many do we have on the right hand side you have 18.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's what we're gonna do i'm gonna draw a line right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Really i'm just gonna draw a line right here and i'm going to say this.\nAndrew Ippolito: i've just gone through a lot of trouble here a lot of work to get to this point. Andrew Ippolito: i'm going to take this one molecule here for myself.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is for my trouble, this is my profit wow this.\nAndrew Ippolito: One G three p. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, the super duper red hot glowing three carbon molecule i'm going to keep them off to the side, how many do I have left over.\nAndrew Ippolito: And by the way, by the way. Andrew Ippolito: yeah yeah 18 So you see the see the three here.\nAndrew Ippolito: right that we kept. Andrew Ippolito: Do we have to make carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now we just breathing some more. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so we really have to make those 15, we have to just make these guys back.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so how many molecules of carbon or how many atoms of carbon are there there's 15 carbons within those three rsvp Okay, you can arrange them like this visually you can think of it like this.\nAndrew Ippolito: 1123345 all right here ready.\nAndrew Ippolito: To.\nthree. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and so now, what I want to do is I want you to pull down the super duper hot ones.\nAndrew Ippolito: 1-231-231-2312 31234 right we have five of those.\nAndrew Ippolito: In DC how these are essentially you're seeing where i'm going with this, I hope so here's what we're currently at these are all these hot three carbon I love how this is working out that was great those look good Okay, we have these these are five g three p.\nAndrew Ippolito: That are high energy. Andrew Ippolito: In other words, we have the energy here that we need to make all of these.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right so imagine now just changing the bonds. Andrew Ippolito: This way.\nAndrew Ippolito: So remove the white ones and use the yellow ones and that's some work right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we can basically regenerate or rsvp and we're back at the beginning and we probably basically after all this we've converted those three low energy carbons into a single three high energy carbons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so the third and final phase we call.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are you BP. Andrew Ippolito: regeneration.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's a carbon cycle. Andrew Ippolito: it's not your book summarizes it very nicely, and it does this, it says three carbon dioxide's."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Comparison of C3 and C4 Plants","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the differences between C3 and C4 plants, highlighting their adaptations to different carbon dioxide levels in the environment.","start":"2:02:57","end":"2:12:57","content":"Andrew Ippolito: And that's a carbon cycle. Andrew Ippolito: it's not your book summarizes it very nicely, and it does this, it says three carbon dioxide's.\nAndrew Ippolito: plus three R E bps.\nAndrew Ippolito: arrow arrow arrow lots of stuff happens. Andrew Ippolito: One GDP.\nAndrew Ippolito: right here, let me go back this way.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's not clear, we try that again.\nAndrew Ippolito: Here we get three carbon dioxide come in.\nAndrew Ippolito: Five, are you bps are already there.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to go through a series of reactions. Andrew Ippolito: Where we get 63 piece.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to pull one out. Andrew Ippolito: And we're going to use the remaining five to rebuild this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I said five rb piece I sit. Andrew Ippolito: There there we go this is kind of more about your book is now so let me summarize that again we take three molecules of the carbon dioxide, we take three molecules of these five carbon sugars, we go through a process where we're putting into it the ATP.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the end a dp. Andrew Ippolito: And we're getting out of it we're pulling out of the cycle with spits out of it is the GDP.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the remaining five GDP. Andrew Ippolito: Get used up to restore the original three rsvp as we meet.\nWe used.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: So all of that work all the light reactions and the photo systems and the electron transport chain and the fatalis is and the building up the gradients and amy bph and.\nAndrew Ippolito: All of this work, the fixation and the reduction and the fixation on the reduction in the fixation on the reduction in the regeneration just to get one stinking three molly three carbon cholesterol to hide plus or hide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Three phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can't even do anything with that. Andrew Ippolito: there's nothing you can do with GDP, you need ready, so now, how do we get glucose where does glucose come in, you do all that again, and you have to take two G three p's.\nAndrew Ippolito: To build what we would call glucose six phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is basically the building block for starch.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you can take D3 up and instead of making some glucose you can go off, and you can make fatty acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can go off and go get some amino acids.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can go off and get other sugars. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, you can go off and there's even processes that help you make some nucleotides or nuclear sides.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's all there's a whole metabolism here where D3 PS to start this is your Annapolis.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I don't want to say you're a novel ISM you certainly don't do any of this, this is the plants Annapolis.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is why we call them the producers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are not just making sugar.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now there's one key metabolite that we need called folic acid probably heard of it before if you're ever going to have children, and one of the things they tell you when you're pregnant is to have high doses of folic acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: We can't synthesize folic acid in our metabolism, we have to consume it in our environment by our food.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, we don't use it for food. Andrew Ippolito: We use it to build things.\nAndrew Ippolito: Bacteria build folic acid from scratch and that's one of the targets of our antibiotics.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so this here this collectively we call the metabolic pool.\nOkay. Andrew Ippolito: Now that you get this now that this makes some sense to you, I can explain this before plans.\nAndrew Ippolito: As easy compared to this. Andrew Ippolito: is just one okay remember you learned the linear electron flow and then you learn the cyclical cyclical it was easier Okay, now that what you just learned was basically see through photosynthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's what we just covered see for photosynthesis has just some minor tweaks to it Okay, these are evolutionary adaptations to allow plans to survive.\nAndrew Ippolito: Really, in a carbon dioxide scant environment, but the consequences of that they can live in hot environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so like the palm fronds behind me here in my little background anywhere in the tropics, these are all see for plants okay up here in the north, we have all see three planets product, I should say predominantly see three planets.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: When I went to Florida to drop my mom off yeah she stayed with us for a few months because of the pandemic, but she she lives in Florida now.\nAndrew Ippolito: I went to drop her off and I walked along the beach and I noticed by our House, the the the.\nAndrew Ippolito: The trees by the beach were like maple trees and I was like what there's no maple trees on a beach, this is stupid, this makes no sense.\nAndrew Ippolito: And I said to myself immediately cuz i've been teaching this up yours, I make those have to be see for maple leaves and I walked up.\nAndrew Ippolito: So I had a little scientific hypothesis in my head i'm like i'm going to predict that these leads are succulent and I looked I grabbed one of the leaves and Sure enough, it was thick and lush I was just like I expected it to be.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because there's no way I see three plants living in that environment they would just wealth right so here's how see for plans work.\nAndrew Ippolito: Go back to the leaf structure and this idea of this domain. Andrew Ippolito: And you have your vascular bundle here i'm just going to draw a circle for that, and the first thing is the first difference is the bundle sheath cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Have chloroplasts. Andrew Ippolito: Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now again the context here is let's just say low carbon dioxide in the environment, this is how they evolved.\nAndrew Ippolito: This isn't what we use them for now there's plenty of carpet house on our environment, but they evolved in the context of this evolutionary stress the stress is I don't have a lot of carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, go back to the idea that for biscoe uses oxygen and carbon dioxide just easily all right and photo respiration.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's how it works, the mess fulfill cells and see for plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Basically, arrange themselves in these concentric rings around the bundle sheet cells which you can imagine, this here is airtight.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And in the cells, right here.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is where carbon fixation occurs. Andrew Ippolito: The first step of the Calvin cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: conversation happens in muscle phil.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then, what happens is the muscle fuel cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: So i'll say which then. Andrew Ippolito: pumps.\nAndrew Ippolito: Carbon. Andrew Ippolito: into the bundle sheath cells, so this is an active process Member pump pumps require energy right so see for plants are not as efficient as the three plants, this requires energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is why, during a modern environment like we live in, see three plants out compete see for plants they're just more efficient when everything's happy.\nAndrew Ippolito: But think of your lawn and August. Andrew Ippolito: and see three plant, the seed three grass starts to wither and the sea floor plan grass, the sea for grass starts to thrive crab grass, you see, for.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's why we see that only in August, because it gets to a point where it starts to be able to out compete the see three plans to see through plans just can't keep up the canteen he could add a kitchen.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so here's how it works here's why that carbon fixation step remember you got CO2 plus this are you BP that first reaction right instead of rubbish go remember rubbish stupid, instead of rubbish go there's another enzyme a specialist who doesn't care about oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: His name is P, p. Andrew Ippolito: Car box ELISE.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what P P O box least does is it produces. Andrew Ippolito: A forum carbon molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: called Maliki. Andrew Ippolito: that's why they call it a see for you see the first product of the first reaction is a for carbon molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: The first product of the first reaction of C three plants is a three carbon molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay you'll you'll notice that.

Andrew Ippolito: You are not a crybaby you're acting like one you see the difference, a subtle difference, but it's the way we form our self images and our our self worth sometimes right you're stupid is very different than your acting stupid.\nAndrew Ippolito: just put the acting in there, because then you can fix that stop acting stupid.\nAndrew Ippolito: No you're not stupid anymore right, whereas if you say you're stupid that's like an intrinsic property you can't change those.\nAndrew Ippolito: We think right. Andrew Ippolito: So rubbish.\nAndrew Ippolito: rubbish go X stupid when it's using oxygen and pee pee car box ELISE I call him, like the vast cousin of the simpler rubbish go.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, this is a highly about enzyme that just it doesn't matter, you can have a super duper high concentration of oxygen in the cell and just a couple of pieces of carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it will find those carbon dioxide and bind to it with a very high affinity and not bind oxygen all where's rubbish go just uses, one of the other.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so, even though, yes, yes, this is the confusing part for some of you as you're learning this and this took me a little bit when I first mastered this.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, rubbish go is fixing carbon right, but everything you learned in the sea three plan is happening there and a bunch of seeds so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the reason why we don't call it carbon fixation there is because carbon was already fixed.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right remember the process of carbon fixation is grabbing that gas from the air and bringing it in P P O box least did that, for us, we put it into malaise and now he's bringing it into the bundle see so and, yes, it's releasing carbon dioxide again but that's part of biological process.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the key here is see for plants.

Andrew Ippolito: This is where P P car box ELISE works.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is Ruby Ruby.

Andrew Ippolito: you're welcome okay so here's what i'm gonna.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do we're gonna think about rubbish go. Andrew Ippolito: And the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide that play out over time here.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, I came up with this. Andrew Ippolito: My last class ask me a question on this so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Think about the idea so we're inside the cell we're in in the environment that rubbish goes.\nAndrew Ippolito: In overtime oxygen levels are pretty low. Andrew Ippolito: Right, but then, when the estimate closes the oxygen levels go up and they'll leave it to a point right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide levels are high. Andrew Ippolito: But then, as the something closes it starts going down to the point where there's none.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so, if you look at this now, at this moment in time.\nAndrew Ippolito: right here, where they cross. Andrew Ippolito: rubbish go is going to use carbon dioxide, so long as the concentrations are higher than the oxygen but the moment that the oxygen becomes higher than the carbon dioxide that's when photo respiration will begin.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right it's a game just play the game out that the kinetics of it, the carbon dioxide still getting used up to make the sugars.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, and the oxygen is going to keep building up because the light reactions are going on, and so, if that's domain closes now you start dealing with the partial pressure of oxygen being greater than the partial pressure of carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And rubbish go can't tell the difference between them it's just going to use whichever there is more of.\nAndrew Ippolito: And this turns out to be responsible for I think it's up to like 50%.\nAndrew Ippolito: A. Andrew Ippolito: Crop yield. Andrew Ippolito: 50% decrease in crop year, so, in other words, farmers that grow see three plant crops, they lose a whole bunch of it in the summer time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because of photo respiration right, so we talked about going through a drought and the crops don't grow that's part of the reason why."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 2) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/f1SMiDZ6qFc?si=kEblWuf0KmMj4DyP","chunkTitle":"Conclusion and Q&A","chunkSummary":"In the final section, Professor Ippolito concludes the lecture and addresses student questions.

Andrew Ippolito: And so, remember i'll give you the very first thing that we're going to play with here this guy right here, of course, you tell me what's the very first key player here what's the name of this thing.\nwhat's his name. Andrew Ippolito: Anybody. Andrew Ippolito: don't look at your notes don't look at your notes this is or try not to look at your notes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he's got an antenna. Andrew Ippolito: he's got the low antenna he's got a reaction Center that has chlorophyll on it.\nZachary Lucas: system. Andrew Ippolito: You got it photo system to okay.\nBranden Lane: there's a reaction Center. Andrew Ippolito: With a pair of chlorophyll. Andrew Ippolito: And the absorb light does anybody remember the name of the reaction Center complex.\nAndrew Ippolito: That has the various colors in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: It starts with the p. Alexa Deprisco: P six at peace sad.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: And remember that six at correspond to a wavelength of light. Andrew Ippolito: that's it sweet spot.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so an electronic its energy energized and leaves.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and and as a consequence what's happening down here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So a pair of electrons get so energized that they leave, and so you would say that photo system to gets what is it oxidize to reduced.\nAndrew Ippolito: oxidized good. Andrew Ippolito: And so, in response. Andrew Ippolito: It is going to oxidize what.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where does it get his replacement electrons from.\nAngela Harbeck: Is it water. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, good Angela. Andrew Ippolito: hey so we got to water molecules here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Get ripped apart into the oxygen guests that we breathe and for protons and i'm process we call what anybody what's the name of that process.\nAndrew Ippolito: Breaking water with light.\nBranden Lane: photo laces. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Branden Lane: photo analysis but. Andrew Ippolito: photo licenses how you say it to get the two words photo and then laces and you say fatalis like hydrolysis right breaking breaking things with water, and here we are breaking water itself okay good and so these pair of electrons get handed off to a series of increasingly electro negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: components that collectively are called the what. Andrew Ippolito: what's this thing called.\nAndrew Ippolito: catches electrons and moves them down hill using their energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do something.\nBranden Lane: Is it that i'm a. Branden Lane: chance up to. Andrew Ippolito: ran into that again.\nBranden Lane: i'm being that kind of stuff did. Andrew Ippolito: Good do okay. Andrew Ippolito: So they are accepting electrons and you would say that the first component on this system is the initial electronics adapter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Collectively we call this the electron. Andrew Ippolito: transport chain you got it.\nAndrew Ippolito: The chain of increasingly electro negative and so basically they're they're playing a game where each component grabs the electron from the last component and so they're increasingly electro negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like stronger and stronger magnets, and so what what work they're doing is they're pumping protons right, and so you could say that there's two ways that the cell is contributing to this pool of protons building up in the thigh liquid space.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so that's the key here is the concentration of protons is vastly increase in here, you could also say that the pH is going.\nAndrew Ippolito: downward trend. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So, remember, we have an enzyme over here now what's the name of the ends on that takes advantage of this gradient of protons.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the name of this enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: At peace and grace excellent. Andrew Ippolito: That is. Andrew Ippolito: ATP synthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: and its job is to take some adenosine di phosphate plus some inorganic phosphate staple them together and give us our first official product of the system ATP good and, of course, those protons can then go back and get pumped back in again so it's a nice sustainable loop there alright.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, meanwhile, there is another component here that looks similar."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 3) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/xKYNRAztGOU?si=7QlUgmJvZ-PiGwqW","chunkTitle":"Electron Transport Chain and ATP Synthesis","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis in the light reactions of photosynthesis.","start":"7:17","end":"9:20","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Alright, meanwhile, there is another component here that looks similar.\nAndrew Ippolito: To photo system to name.\nAlexis Micewski: One good.

Andrew Ippolito: that's the piece of 100 so the key there that higher number corresponds to a longer wavelength.\nAndrew Ippolito: corresponding to a lower energy so photo system one isn't as good as photo system to it's not it doesn't capture.\nAndrew Ippolito: As much high energy so it's the weaker of the two and it's the first one to have evolved, it turns out that's why it's named photo system one the initial system it's not strong enough to break water, so it does not generate oxygen gas.\nAndrew Ippolito: Instead it energizes that pair of electrons.

Andrew Ippolito: So what does it use that's that's a really good way of thinking about the differentiator so So the question is, where does it get it replacement electrons photo system to get it from water, where does photo system one get it from.\nAngela Harbeck: The electron transport chain. Andrew Ippolito: Good and that's a really good way to think about it. Angela Harbeck: Okay okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now does anybody remember. Andrew Ippolito: linear So this was linear electron flow, the idea of the electrons loads and a highlighter going through the system and leaving.\nAndrew Ippolito: linear electron flow. Andrew Ippolito: what's the counter to that what's the other mode of electrons.\nVictoria Bloemker: doing things like. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: cyclical electron flow or cyclical natural flow potato potato and how's that work.\nAndrew Ippolito: who's the key what, what are the the two key players and what we'll call cyclical electronic flow.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the two anybody. Branden Lane: Yes. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, good good ps1 use a different color here.\nBranden Lane: All right. and\nAndrew Ippolito: Is any dp redux he's involved in this. Branden Lane: Now. Branden Lane: Good up.\nAndrew Ippolito: say that again. Andrew Ippolito: ATP okay okay yep yep.\nAndrew Ippolito: The whole. Andrew Ippolito: ATP synthesis complex is there Okay, and then there's one other key player.\nTaylor Campbell: Would it be PS. Andrew Ippolito: So no so PS two is actually out of play and stuff like that, so this.\nTaylor Campbell: Is not ever one or the other it's always just. Taylor Campbell: Yes, one. Andrew Ippolito: Right it's always peaceful for cyclic flow yeah so ps1 is involved them both and this is how you can look at it cyclic flow evolve first.\nAndrew Ippolito: What we're about to cover here is the most primitive version of photosynthesis that was always there and then what we do is we take that simpler system when we we add complexity to it and we get the linear flow already So who is your only other one we haven't talked about yet.\nTaylor Campbell: electron transport. Taylor Campbell: Exactly. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's how that works. Andrew Ippolito: As the sun shines down let's use yellow here as the sun shines down on photo system one photo system ones electrons get energized and instead of handing it to the enzyme it hands it back here to the electron transport chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the electron transport chain does what it does, it does a proton pumping it uses the energy and those electrons it cools them down.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then it hands them back to photo system month and so you can see here, this is what keeps.\nAndrew Ippolito: These this mode of photosynthesis alive the idea that the electrons are getting energized and just being used to pump protons which, in turn, then drive the ATP synthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so plants that undergo or really any photosynthetic organism that undergoes cyclic flow can generate some ATP from it.\nAndrew Ippolito: But not anything else it can't produce sugars, because there is no na de pH being produced and that's a key building block to the sugars that's what's going to give us those powerful chemical bonds right remember that any D pH we call this.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a market that has what we call reducing potential.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you need reducing potential to build complex organic molecules you can build complex organic molecules simply with phosphorylation which would ATP gives us.\nTaylor Campbell: So in the Calvin cycle, it talks about how the electrons don't move like to a higher energy level.\nTaylor Campbell: Like. Taylor Campbell: They don't. Andrew Ippolito: They don't move too high energy right they're gonna come. Andrew Ippolito: If anything they're going downhill, a little bit.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah they talk about how like when they're heated and like how they're moving like how they bounce like to move that they're not actually moving like like to a higher energy level.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right right so they've been moved to a higher energy level at this moment, right here. Taylor Campbell: Soon, so they do do it in the light reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, yes that's what makes them go away. Andrew Ippolito: Is they get bumped up to a higher energy state. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah if you're thinking about the chemistry involved in this. Andrew Ippolito: that's exactly right, so the Calvin by the time it gets to the Calvin cycle they've already been energized and we're going to take that.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you think of it from an energy diagram the energies up here we're gonna have to go downhill, not all the way we're not going all the way down a carbon dioxide and water but we're going to stop here, we still have to go down a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're going down a couple fighter stairs anytime you build anything you're going down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you have to go up to go down, yes we're down to go up it's a riddle there somewhere yeah so you can summarize it all in and as kind of simple.\nAndrew Ippolito: Energy diagram let's see if I can do this, so we start out right so there's the low energy components carbon dioxide and water right.\nAndrew Ippolito: There low in energy will think about energy here. Andrew Ippolito: And I don't know this is time I don't know what it is just as as we move forward in the reactions, so we have these low energy molecules right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we have high energy photons let's abbreviate that with the Lambda here right, so we have high energy electron of photons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And therefore right we're going to have high energy electrons let's look at it that way, great because you can't do anything with a photon right, you need matter that's energy, we need to put it into into matter and so we're gonna put it in some electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so Tyler said the electrons potential energy decreases as it moves, yes, that is exactly the right way to think of it good.\nAndrew Ippolito: She said the electrons potential energy decreases as it moves down the electron transport chain good there's actually there's a good slide and the PowerPoint deck that has the actual precise numbers in there, you can even see it it's called the their electro their potential.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay we're going to take this high energy pair of electrons and we're gonna put them into these low energy molecules are This is how the Calvin cycle works and we get that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so that that is a ridiculous simple summary of everything right we're going to take these high energy electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are we're going to take those high energy electrons and put them into these low energy molecules carbon dioxide and water we're going to create.\nAndrew Ippolito: This high So you see where I drew it do you see how I put you through here right it's underneath the electron but well above these guys.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we think of it, you know, in a there's an Iraqi of energy OK, so the sun's obviously at the highest point here we can't go past that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so those electrons are the highest we're going to get in the biosphere that's as that's as big as we can so photo system to, which is what does all that right.\nAndrew Ippolito: There the photo system to is the most oxidative thing in biology it's so powerful of an oxidative burns water right it oxidizes water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so that right that's where we get the electrons from in fact so so you can also maybe we can maybe tailor this there's nothing wrong with what I just wrote, but we can do a little more accurately, we can say that light right goes into.\nAndrew Ippolito: And grabs the electrons from water pumps them up, and then it uses the carbon dioxide as a source of the carbon to make this high energy three carbon molecule GDP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so this right here is a product of the Calvin cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well we're going to see. Andrew Ippolito: We can take two of those. Andrew Ippolito: And we can make our glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: My we're going to do today is we're going to break glucose back down to GDP really let's so glucose is even higher and energy right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because there's two of them in there, so we're gonna we're gonna do so respiration is all about breaking that back down to.\nAndrew Ippolito: To be PG. Andrew Ippolito: To three PG, which is also P go.\nAndrew Ippolito: To pvp. Andrew Ippolito: To pirate, by the way, don't don't worry if you can't do that I can finally do that i'll say I wasn't able to do that myself.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can do that now so i'm like I would never expect you to be able to just rattle those off this is like the intermediate of like houses, the idea here is you get to pirate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, which. Andrew Ippolito: Technically let's let's take let's take all of that, I want to do the energy stuff accurately, so I want to bring all these up here, so I have some more breathing room.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because I want to show a pirate is still well above carbon dioxide in terms of words energies right so there's this downhill trend and i'm on this downhill in this extra Yannick process we're going to make some ATP and we're going to make some nadh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's that's like houses in a nutshell. Andrew Ippolito: And then, in the presence of oxygen we're going to further oxidized movie.\nAndrew Ippolito: Until we basically get back these guys it's all connected.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so when you're done with this one of the things you can study on Thursday, when you're done with studying chapters nine and 10 is you can put it all together in one big grand master.\nAndrew Ippolito: diagram photosynthesis and so respiration it's all connected and and that's the simple story.\nAndrew Ippolito: The output is always going to be ultimately eats up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so electrons are going up and down and they're being bopped around and all these intermediates it's very messy so his life it's a good allegory for life itself.\nAngela Harbeck: um I know this is a little bit of a stupid question but. Andrew Ippolito: it's not stupid go ahead.\nAngela Harbeck: The focus of this is obviously you're dealing with like the chloroplasts you're not dealing with the mitochondria right and.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a no that's a great question because we're all thinking about one of the things that your brains are going to start to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Once you kind of start getting this is you're going to start asking deeper questions like where is this happening. Andrew Ippolito: You know what's, what are the grander structures and so here, I can give you a very simple diagram.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's a plan so. Andrew Ippolito: Okay here's the big central vacuum.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so let's say here's the chloroplasts. Andrew Ippolito: With the final equation it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then hey let's put our mitochondria over here. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so don't forget this, this when you were in grade school you learn plants have chloroplasts and animal cells have mitochondria right, that was a lie.\nAndrew Ippolito: everybody's got mitochondria plants and animals have mitochondria and fungus.\nAndrew Ippolito: And most, but not all most protein Okay, so if you're eukaryotic cell you've got to mitochondria that's one of the things that you come with along with your nucleus, and your linear chromosomes and your cellular organelles that have membranes right good Jordan.\nJordan Russell: Can you hear me. Jordan Russell: yeah Okay, I have a slightly weird slightly off topic question about mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: Specifically, the powerhouse of the cell sorry. Jordan Russell: Well, besides that but, like you know in how humans, how you can trace back, like everyone has their mothers mitochondria just like keep tracing back is that kind of the same plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, yeah we actually call, there was a human genetic analysis done that trait so.\nAndrew Ippolito: back when I was in high school, there were two competing theories about human emergence mom was called the out of Africa theory and the other I forgot the other one was called up by this point because it was now it's now outmoded.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the the proof in the pudding for that was doing a mitochondrial DNA analysis, because we all inherit our mitochondria from just our mothers, it comes from the egg cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: They were able to do this. Andrew Ippolito: International like the largest scale genetic analysis, you know they wanted to rural villages everywhere into blood samples and.\nAndrew Ippolito: They they sequence mitochondrial DNA and they traced it all back to Africa. Andrew Ippolito: And so they were able to trace it back to what you would think of Now is our pool of females that originated in Africa and they call that mitochondrial Eve.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is just a lovely little connection there so there's mitochondrial Eve, and then there was a separate analysis done years later on.\nAndrew Ippolito: The y chromosome the one that only males have and they trace that back to I don't know what the y chromosome Adam.\nAndrew Ippolito: Genetic Adam and they both both of those analysis all traced back to Africa.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we now know with you know as high confidence as we possibly can, that all humanity came from Africa, we started in Africa and there's a really great documentary on netflix that that talks about all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And one of the most profound pieces of that are this through a simple little bit of video where they go into some of these villages and the year so so we never left Africa right we there's also people still in Africa, to this day from 2 million years ago when we are i'm sorry i'm sorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: somewhere around 500,000 years ago is when humans really took the form of our current modern physiological human when you look at their faces, you see, everybody in them.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, the diversity of all what we call sociologically races all the different races are represented in their morphology of their faces you see.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know Asian esque faces you see South American use every anything everything in between it's amazing it was really profound to see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so anyway, no that's a good question okay so battery Angeles question about the mitochondria chloroplasts now already so understand that that 50% of the sugars that plants make.\nAndrew Ippolito: are used for the plant to eat right, so they truly they make their own food they eat.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so they're still glycol genesis and they're still the Krebs cycle and they're still all this, all this stuff we're going to learn about today is happening and all you carry those.\nAndrew Ippolito: plants, animals and fungus and produce Okay, there are like a handful of species of proteins that we found don't have the mitochondria they lost it over time we still don't fully understand how they survive.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just it makes it, but you know protein that's just how they are they're there they keep us guessing.\nAndrew Ippolito: You could also say that purchaser just an evolutionary experiment that is continuing to go on after a couple billion years.\nAndrew Ippolito: right there, so there are chloroplasts that look like mitochondria and their mitochondria locally chloroplasts in terms of their internal membranes.\nAndrew Ippolito: right there, there are mitochondria that have fila quite like stacks instead of Chris day so there's all sorts of craziness out there okay So here we go Angela you got where the sun shines down here we make some sugars.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then those sugars are metabolized in the cytoplasm and then some of those things go in here and which we'll talk about today so that's the connection.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Angela Harbeck: So photosynthesis is the core classes and cellular respiration is mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a great way to think of it yeah. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and really let's. Andrew Ippolito: add the cytoplasm in there because we're going to see that the first steps of cell respiration the breakdown of sugar in glycol says that's actually in the cytoplasm.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when we remember the oxygen we need right oxygens would oxygens our ticket into the mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: Without without oxygen we don't get in there. Andrew Ippolito: And so we'll learn about fermentation, which is part of the alternative process fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen so respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we'll call it aerobic respiration. Andrew Ippolito: don't worry about anaerobic respiration right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has tell her someone with first are all this this overwhelming and there's a lot of info it's it's definitely the case here.\nAlexa Deprisco: Excuse me, yes um I don't know, are we done like talking about plants and at this point like the Calvin cycle everything."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 3) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/xKYNRAztGOU?si=7QlUgmJvZ-PiGwqW","chunkTitle":"Q&A: Calvin Cycle and C4 Plants","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito answers questions about the Calvin cycle, C4 plants, and the enzyme involved in the C4 pathway.","start":"27:52","end":"29:41","content":"Alexa Deprisco: Excuse me, yes um I don't know, are we done like talking about plants and at this point like the Calvin cycle everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are we done talking about which part.

Andrew Ippolito: No, no i'm still fielding questions you want to do want to ask a question, or do you want to guess question about something after all that.\nAlexa Deprisco: I guess it's it's relating to like this see for Calvin cycle specifically.

Alexa Deprisco: yeah i'm looking out my window.\nAlexa Deprisco: Okay, so I have my thing over here so uh let's see for molecule moves into the bundle sheets so and then it is broken.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah you see here. Alexa Deprisco: Do we have to know the name of the enzyme. Andrew Ippolito: No, no, no, no, no. Andrew Ippolito: You don't you don't even have to.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah just know that we pumped up for carbon molecule other and a.

Andrew Ippolito: So we're just we're parsing out right now the light reaction of the Calvin cycle, as it relates to the three main modes of photosynthesis the see three the sea, for they can.\nAndrew Ippolito: See three photosynthesis so all three all three of the light reactions occur in the same place in the liquid membranes great the Calvin cycle and the see three plants occurs and just the mass of fuel cells, so this is the most efficient motives of photosynthesis see.\nAndrew Ippolito: it's also the one that subject to photo i'm sorry yeah photo respiration.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you recall, for the respiration is when we use oxygen instead of carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and that's done by that enzyme rubbish go.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we have to get around that so these these see for the can plant mechanisms evolved to counter the the inefficiency of rubbish go really so see for plants have the carbon fixation step occur in the muscle phil, whereas the other two steps occur in the butter sheet cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Can plants fix carbon at night when it's cold.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they do the rest of this stuff. Andrew Ippolito: During the day when there's energy available because of the light.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we'll talk about that the end of this little mini lecture okay so that's that's the context.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's what i'm gonna do we're gonna we're gonna set up the game here and i'm going to ask you questions alright, so the first question is.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, so here let's set the groundwork here we're inside the cell and we're gonna here let's do some colors here green we got so this is the liquid memory.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: that's the liquid membrane. Andrew Ippolito: And so, remember i'll give you the very first thing that we're going to play with here this guy right here, of course, you tell me what's the very first key player here what's the name of this thing.\nwhat's his name. Andrew Ippolito: Anybody. Andrew Ippolito: don't look at your notes don't look at your notes this is or try not to look at your notes.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he's got an antenna. Andrew Ippolito: he's got the low antenna he's got a reaction Center that has chlorophyll on it.\nZachary Lucas: system. Andrew Ippolito: You got it photo system to okay.\nBranden Lane: there's a reaction Center. Andrew Ippolito: With a pair of chlorophyll. Andrew Ippolito: And the absorb light does anybody remember the name of the reaction Center complex.\nAndrew Ippolito: That has the various colors in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: It starts with the p. Alexa Deprisco: P six at peace sad.\nAndrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: And remember that six at correspond to a wavelength of light. Andrew Ippolito: that's it sweet spot.\nAndrew Ippolito: All right, so an electronic its energy energized and leaves.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and and as a consequence what's happening down here.\nAndrew Ippolito: So a pair of electrons get so energized that they leave, and so you would say that photo system to gets what is it oxidize to reduced.\nAndrew Ippolito: oxidized good. Andrew Ippolito: And so, in response. Andrew Ippolito: It is going to oxidize what.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where does it get his replacement electrons from.\nAngela Harbeck: Is it water. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, good Angela. Andrew Ippolito: hey so we got to water molecules here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Get ripped apart into the oxygen guests that we breathe and for protons and i'm process we call what anybody what's the name of that process.\nAndrew Ippolito: Breaking water with light.\nBranden Lane: photo laces. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Branden Lane: photo analysis but. Andrew Ippolito: photo licenses how you say it to get the two words photo and then laces and you say fatalis like hydrolysis right breaking breaking things with water, and here we are breaking water itself okay good and so these pair of electrons get handed off to a series of increasingly electro negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: components that collectively are called the what. Andrew Ippolito: what's this thing called.\nAndrew Ippolito: catches electrons and moves them down hill using their energy.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do something.\nBranden Lane: Is it that i'm a. Branden Lane: chance up to. Andrew Ippolito: ran into that again.\nBranden Lane: i'm being that kind of stuff did. Andrew Ippolito: Good do okay. Andrew Ippolito: So they are accepting electrons and you would say that the first component on this system is the initial electronics adapter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Collectively we call this the electron. Andrew Ippolito: transport chain you got it.\nAndrew Ippolito: The chain of increasingly electro negative and so basically they're they're playing a game where each component grabs the electron from the last component and so they're increasingly electro negative.\nAndrew Ippolito: Like stronger and stronger magnets, and so what what work they're doing is they're pumping protons right, and so you could say that there's two ways that the cell is contributing to this pool of protons building up in the thigh liquid space.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so that's the key here is the concentration of protons is vastly increase in here, you could also say that the pH is going.\nAndrew Ippolito: downward trend. Andrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: So, remember, we have an enzyme over here now what's the name of the ends on that takes advantage of this gradient of protons.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's the name of this enzyme.\nAndrew Ippolito: At peace and grace excellent. Andrew Ippolito: That is. Andrew Ippolito: ATP synthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: and its job is to take some adenosine di phosphate plus some inorganic phosphate staple them together and give us our first official product of the system ATP good and, of course, those protons can then go back and get pumped back in again so it's a nice sustainable loop there alright.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, meanwhile, there is another component here that looks similar.\nAndrew Ippolito: To photo system to name.\nAlexis Micewski: One good. Andrew Ippolito: photos just a month and what's the name of photo system ones like complex.\nAlexis Micewski: piece of murder good. Andrew Ippolito: that's the piece of 100 so the key there that higher number corresponds to a longer wavelength.\nAndrew Ippolito: corresponding to a lower energy so photo system one isn't as good as photo system to it's not it doesn't capture.\nAndrew Ippolito: As much high energy so it's the weaker of the two and it's the first one to have evolved, it turns out that's why it's named photo system one the initial system it's not strong enough to break water, so it does not generate oxygen gas.\nAndrew Ippolito: Instead it energizes that pair of electrons. Andrew Ippolito: And what does it do to them, where does it bring them who's right here, waiting in the wings during a typical linear electron flow.\nAndrew Ippolito: what's this thing. Alexis Micewski: Any dp this case.\nAndrew Ippolito: got yeah yeah and adp redux good any dp P for plant and EDP reduction.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, as its name suggests, the redux enzyme will reduce it substrate, and so what comes in, is any dp in its oxidized form and a dp plus.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're going to take those high energy electrons and protons, of course, and we're going to staple on to it, those pair of high energy electrons and create any D pH, which is the second and final product of the light reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay now there's one last little consequence here, if you remember the these electrons that leave that now find themselves here.\nAndrew Ippolito: have to get replaced and they get replaced by that electron transport chain. Andrew Ippolito: Right, so if you think of the flow Okay, this is how so Taylor when you asked about how to remember all this think of it like a complex game you start here in water, you have a pair of electrons and water.\n"},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 3) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/xKYNRAztGOU?si=7QlUgmJvZ-PiGwqW","chunkTitle":"Light Reactions","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses the light reactions in photosynthesis.

He also explains the role of water in the light reactions and the production of oxygen as a byproduct.","start":"9:21","end":"29:47","content":"Andrew Ippolito: Okay, they get passed on to photo system to that they get handed off to the electron transport chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: Then they get handed to photo system one and they get handed to the enzyme any dp reductive, and so they find themselves here and add pH and then they're going to be going they're going to go over and be using the Calvin cycle to put those two high energy electrons into a sugar molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so basically you can summarize, this is thinking about thinking of it this way we're going to take the energy from the sun.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna use that energy from the sun to heat up a pair of electrons and keep that energy in that pair of electrons and then store that energy into organic molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: And we're just going to do that forever and that's that's the basics okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: So, are there any questions now on this, this is the last time you're going to get me to focus on the light reactions before the test.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's not something recorded anyway.\nAndrew Ippolito: So it was there any pain point here is anything, it should it should make sense but that's to my brain that's been looking at this, for 10 years.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can only imagine how many different views, there are to this, so let me see if I can correct any incorrect perceptions of those before we move on.\nAngela Harbeck: So the difference between a photo system one and two other than like the p 786 80 at is that, like photo system to uses water.\nAngela Harbeck: And then photo system one doesn't. Andrew Ippolito: So what does it use that's that's a really good way of thinking about the differentiator so So the question is, where does it get it replacement electrons photo system to get it from water, where does photo system one get it from.\nAngela Harbeck: The electron transport chain. Andrew Ippolito: Good and that's a really good way to think about it. Angela Harbeck: Okay okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: Now does anybody remember. Andrew Ippolito: linear So this was linear electron flow, the idea of the electrons loads and a highlighter going through the system and leaving.\nAndrew Ippolito: linear electron flow. Andrew Ippolito: what's the counter to that what's the other mode of electrons.\nVictoria Bloemker: doing things like. Andrew Ippolito: Good. Andrew Ippolito: cyclical electron flow or cyclical natural flow potato potato and how's that work.\nAndrew Ippolito: who's the key what, what are the the two key players and what we'll call cyclical electronic flow.\nAndrew Ippolito: One of the two anybody. Branden Lane: Yes. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, good good ps1 use a different color here.\nBranden Lane: All right. and\nAndrew Ippolito: Is any dp redux he's involved in this. Branden Lane: Now. Branden Lane: Good up.\nAndrew Ippolito: say that again. Andrew Ippolito: ATP okay okay yep yep.\nAndrew Ippolito: The whole. Andrew Ippolito: ATP synthesis complex is there Okay, and then there's one other key player.\nTaylor Campbell: Would it be PS. Andrew Ippolito: So no so PS two is actually out of play and stuff like that, so this.\nTaylor Campbell: Is not ever one or the other it's always just. Taylor Campbell: Yes, one. Andrew Ippolito: Right it's always peaceful for cyclic flow yeah so ps1 is involved them both and this is how you can look at it cyclic flow evolve first.\nAndrew Ippolito: What we're about to cover here is the most primitive version of photosynthesis that was always there and then what we do is we take that simpler system when we we add complexity to it and we get the linear flow already So who is your only other one we haven't talked about yet.\nTaylor Campbell: electron transport. Taylor Campbell: Exactly. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so here's how that works. Andrew Ippolito: As the sun shines down let's use yellow here as the sun shines down on photo system one photo system ones electrons get energized and instead of handing it to the enzyme it hands it back here to the electron transport chain.\nAndrew Ippolito: And the electron transport chain does what it does, it does a proton pumping it uses the energy and those electrons it cools them down.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then it hands them back to photo system month and so you can see here, this is what keeps.\nAndrew Ippolito: These this mode of photosynthesis alive the idea that the electrons are getting energized and just being used to pump protons which, in turn, then drive the ATP synthesis.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so plants that undergo or really any photosynthetic organism that undergoes cyclic flow can generate some ATP from it.\nAndrew Ippolito: But not anything else it can't produce sugars, because there is no na de pH being produced and that's a key building block to the sugars that's what's going to give us those powerful chemical bonds right remember that any D pH we call this.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a market that has what we call reducing potential.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you need reducing potential to build complex organic molecules you can build complex organic molecules simply with phosphorylation which would ATP gives us.\nTaylor Campbell: So in the Calvin cycle, it talks about how the electrons don't move like to a higher energy level.\nTaylor Campbell: Like. Taylor Campbell: They don't. Andrew Ippolito: They don't move too high energy right they're gonna come. Andrew Ippolito: If anything they're going downhill, a little bit.\nTaylor Campbell: yeah they talk about how like when they're heated and like how they're moving like how they bounce like to move that they're not actually moving like like to a higher energy level.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right right so they've been moved to a higher energy level at this moment, right here. Taylor Campbell: Soon, so they do do it in the light reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, yes that's what makes them go away. Andrew Ippolito: Is they get bumped up to a higher energy state. Okay.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah if you're thinking about the chemistry involved in this. Andrew Ippolito: that's exactly right, so the Calvin by the time it gets to the Calvin cycle they've already been energized and we're going to take that.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you think of it from an energy diagram the energies up here we're gonna have to go downhill, not all the way we're not going all the way down a carbon dioxide and water but we're going to stop here, we still have to go down a little bit.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're going down a couple fighter stairs anytime you build anything you're going down.\nAndrew Ippolito: Do you have to go up to go down, yes we're down to go up it's a riddle there somewhere yeah so you can summarize it all in and as kind of simple.\nAndrew Ippolito: Energy diagram let's see if I can do this, so we start out right so there's the low energy components carbon dioxide and water right.\nAndrew Ippolito: There low in energy will think about energy here. Andrew Ippolito: And I don't know this is time I don't know what it is just as as we move forward in the reactions, so we have these low energy molecules right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then we have high energy photons let's abbreviate that with the Lambda here right, so we have high energy electron of photons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And therefore right we're going to have high energy electrons let's look at it that way, great because you can't do anything with a photon right, you need matter that's energy, we need to put it into into matter and so we're gonna put it in some electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so Tyler said the electrons potential energy decreases as it moves, yes, that is exactly the right way to think of it good.\nAndrew Ippolito: She said the electrons potential energy decreases as it moves down the electron transport chain good there's actually there's a good slide and the PowerPoint deck that has the actual precise numbers in there, you can even see it it's called the their electro their potential.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay we're going to take this high energy pair of electrons and we're gonna put them into these low energy molecules are This is how the Calvin cycle works and we get that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, so that that is a ridiculous simple summary of everything right we're going to take these high energy electrons.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are we're going to take those high energy electrons and put them into these low energy molecules carbon dioxide and water we're going to create.\nAndrew Ippolito: This high So you see where I drew it do you see how I put you through here right it's underneath the electron but well above these guys.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we think of it, you know, in a there's an Iraqi of energy OK, so the sun's obviously at the highest point here we can't go past that.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so those electrons are the highest we're going to get in the biosphere that's as that's as big as we can so photo system to, which is what does all that right.\nAndrew Ippolito: There the photo system to is the most oxidative thing in biology it's so powerful of an oxidative burns water right it oxidizes water.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, so that right that's where we get the electrons from in fact so so you can also maybe we can maybe tailor this there's nothing wrong with what I just wrote, but we can do a little more accurately, we can say that light right goes into.\nAndrew Ippolito: And grabs the electrons from water pumps them up, and then it uses the carbon dioxide as a source of the carbon to make this high energy three carbon molecule GDP.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so this right here is a product of the Calvin cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well we're going to see. Andrew Ippolito: We can take two of those. Andrew Ippolito: And we can make our glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: My we're going to do today is we're going to break glucose back down to GDP really let's so glucose is even higher and energy right.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because there's two of them in there, so we're gonna we're gonna do so respiration is all about breaking that back down to.\nAndrew Ippolito: To be PG. Andrew Ippolito: To three PG, which is also P go.\nAndrew Ippolito: To pvp. Andrew Ippolito: To pirate, by the way, don't don't worry if you can't do that I can finally do that i'll say I wasn't able to do that myself.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can do that now so i'm like I would never expect you to be able to just rattle those off this is like the intermediate of like houses, the idea here is you get to pirate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, which. Andrew Ippolito: Technically let's let's take let's take all of that, I want to do the energy stuff accurately, so I want to bring all these up here, so I have some more breathing room.\nAndrew Ippolito: right because I want to show a pirate is still well above carbon dioxide in terms of words energies right so there's this downhill trend and i'm on this downhill in this extra Yannick process we're going to make some ATP and we're going to make some nadh.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so that's that's like houses in a nutshell. Andrew Ippolito: And then, in the presence of oxygen we're going to further oxidized movie.\nAndrew Ippolito: Until we basically get back these guys it's all connected.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so when you're done with this one of the things you can study on Thursday, when you're done with studying chapters nine and 10 is you can put it all together in one big grand master.\nAndrew Ippolito: diagram photosynthesis and so respiration it's all connected and and that's the simple story.\nAndrew Ippolito: The output is always going to be ultimately eats up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay. Andrew Ippolito: And so electrons are going up and down and they're being bopped around and all these intermediates it's very messy so his life it's a good allegory for life itself.\nAngela Harbeck: um I know this is a little bit of a stupid question but. Andrew Ippolito: it's not stupid go ahead.\nAngela Harbeck: The focus of this is obviously you're dealing with like the chloroplasts you're not dealing with the mitochondria right and.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a no that's a great question because we're all thinking about one of the things that your brains are going to start to do.\nAndrew Ippolito: Once you kind of start getting this is you're going to start asking deeper questions like where is this happening. Andrew Ippolito: You know what's, what are the grander structures and so here, I can give you a very simple diagram.\nAndrew Ippolito: So here's a plan so. Andrew Ippolito: Okay here's the big central vacuum.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so let's say here's the chloroplasts. Andrew Ippolito: With the final equation it right.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then hey let's put our mitochondria over here. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so don't forget this, this when you were in grade school you learn plants have chloroplasts and animal cells have mitochondria right, that was a lie.\nAndrew Ippolito: everybody's got mitochondria plants and animals have mitochondria and fungus.\nAndrew Ippolito: And most, but not all most protein Okay, so if you're eukaryotic cell you've got to mitochondria that's one of the things that you come with along with your nucleus, and your linear chromosomes and your cellular organelles that have membranes right good Jordan.\nJordan Russell: Can you hear me. Jordan Russell: yeah Okay, I have a slightly weird slightly off topic question about mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: Specifically, the powerhouse of the cell sorry. Jordan Russell: Well, besides that but, like you know in how humans, how you can trace back, like everyone has their mothers mitochondria just like keep tracing back is that kind of the same plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: Yes, yeah we actually call, there was a human genetic analysis done that trait so.\nAndrew Ippolito: back when I was in high school, there were two competing theories about human emergence mom was called the out of Africa theory and the other I forgot the other one was called up by this point because it was now it's now outmoded.\nAndrew Ippolito: But the the proof in the pudding for that was doing a mitochondrial DNA analysis, because we all inherit our mitochondria from just our mothers, it comes from the egg cell.\nAndrew Ippolito: They were able to do this.

Andrew Ippolito: And so they were able to trace it back to what you would think of Now is our pool of females that originated in Africa and they call that mitochondrial Eve.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is just a lovely little connection there so there's mitochondrial Eve, and then there was a separate analysis done years later on.\nAndrew Ippolito: The y chromosome the one that only males have and they trace that back to I don't know what the y chromosome Adam.\nAndrew Ippolito: Genetic Adam and they both both of those analysis all traced back to Africa.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we now know with you know as high confidence as we possibly can, that all humanity came from Africa, we started in Africa and there's a really great documentary on netflix that that talks about all this.\nAndrew Ippolito: And one of the most profound pieces of that are this through a simple little bit of video where they go into some of these villages and the year so so we never left Africa right we there's also people still in Africa, to this day from 2 million years ago when we are i'm sorry i'm sorry.\nAndrew Ippolito: somewhere around 500,000 years ago is when humans really took the form of our current modern physiological human when you look at their faces, you see, everybody in them.\nAndrew Ippolito: You see, the diversity of all what we call sociologically races all the different races are represented in their morphology of their faces you see.\nAndrew Ippolito: You know Asian esque faces you see South American use every anything everything in between it's amazing it was really profound to see that.\nAndrew Ippolito: So so anyway, no that's a good question okay so battery Angeles question about the mitochondria chloroplasts now already so understand that that 50% of the sugars that plants make.\nAndrew Ippolito: are used for the plant to eat right, so they truly they make their own food they eat.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so they're still glycol genesis and they're still the Krebs cycle and they're still all this, all this stuff we're going to learn about today is happening and all you carry those.\nAndrew Ippolito: plants, animals and fungus and produce Okay, there are like a handful of species of proteins that we found don't have the mitochondria they lost it over time we still don't fully understand how they survive.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just it makes it, but you know protein that's just how they are they're there they keep us guessing.\nAndrew Ippolito: You could also say that purchaser just an evolutionary experiment that is continuing to go on after a couple billion years.\nAndrew Ippolito: right there, so there are chloroplasts that look like mitochondria and their mitochondria locally chloroplasts in terms of their internal membranes.\nAndrew Ippolito: right there, there are mitochondria that have fila quite like stacks instead of Chris day so there's all sorts of craziness out there okay So here we go Angela you got where the sun shines down here we make some sugars.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then those sugars are metabolized in the cytoplasm and then some of those things go in here and which we'll talk about today so that's the connection.\nAndrew Ippolito: That makes sense. Angela Harbeck: So photosynthesis is the core classes and cellular respiration is mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: that's a great way to think of it yeah. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, and really let's. Andrew Ippolito: add the cytoplasm in there because we're going to see that the first steps of cell respiration the breakdown of sugar in glycol says that's actually in the cytoplasm.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so, when we remember the oxygen we need right oxygens would oxygens our ticket into the mitochondria.\nAndrew Ippolito: Without without oxygen we don't get in there. Andrew Ippolito: And so we'll learn about fermentation, which is part of the alternative process fermentation occurs in the absence of oxygen so respiration occurs in the presence of oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: So we'll call it aerobic respiration. Andrew Ippolito: don't worry about anaerobic respiration right now.\nAndrew Ippolito: Has tell her someone with first are all this this overwhelming and there's a lot of info it's it's definitely the case here.\nAlexa Deprisco: Excuse me, yes um I don't know, are we done like talking about plants and at this point like the Calvin cycle everything.\nAndrew Ippolito: Are we done talking about which part. Alexa Deprisco: I guess like the Calvin cycle and everything like we're just we're. Andrew Ippolito: No, no i'm still fielding questions you want to do want to ask a question, or do you want to guess question about something after all that.\nAlexa Deprisco: I guess it's it's relating to like this see for Calvin cycle specifically. Andrew Ippolito: sure.\nAlexa Deprisco: Good so like it says. Andrew Ippolito: Looking at your window aren't you. Alexa Deprisco: yeah i'm looking out my window.\nAlexa Deprisco: Okay, so I have my thing over here so uh let's see for molecule moves into the bundle sheets so and then it is broken.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah you see here. Alexa Deprisco: Do we have to know the name of the enzyme. Andrew Ippolito: No, no, no, no, no. Andrew Ippolito: You don't you don't even have to.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah just know that we pumped up for carbon molecule other and a. Andrew Ippolito: Pig degrades back into a three plus one.\nAndrew Ippolito: You drink enough to know that yeah So the idea is here, if this is the bundle sheets so, and this is the muscle feel so so phil.\nAndrew Ippolito: banerjee so we take this for carbon molecule we pump it across so that requires energy right there's a reason why see four plus or less efficient than see to replace, we need to put energy into this that we don't otherwise need.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and then the three carbon molecule plus one quarter mile basically it's like think think of the three quarter molecules a taxi cab.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're bringing the passenger into the bundle csl dropping them off and then we're going to go back and pick up another one and that taxi is the p P, the phosphoenolpyruvate.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then the for carbon molecule it creates is called malaise you do often o'malley because you're going to see him again when we do sell respiration muscle gaming your head so Mally is the for carbon molecule that is the first product of the first reaction.\nTaylor Campbell: Okay, so you said that it needs energy that see three.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah right here that pump we're pumping the mallet into the bundle she's so. Andrew Ippolito: And so that just record you don't have to worry about the details or there's a pump it requires ATP, just like the sodium potassium pump we learned about."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 3) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/xKYNRAztGOU?si=7QlUgmJvZ-PiGwqW","chunkTitle":"Artificially Elevating Carbon Dioxide Concentration","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito explains the process of artificially elevating carbon dioxide concentration in plants.

Taylor Campbell: The Calvin cycle, how you did the light site um yeah the light reaction.\nAndrew Ippolito: You want me to go over yeah yeah we can do that. Andrew Ippolito: Are there any other questions on the light reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's go back up here what a mess.\nAndrew Ippolito: alexa, would you be willing to show us your your window i'm really curious to know what it looks like now, I want to see how.\nAndrew Ippolito: Complicated it got you don't have to if you're if it's Okay, you can show me later if you while you're taking a picture of screenshots and i'm just I want to see what it looks like.\nAlexa Deprisco: I guess, I mean like I have the Calvin cycle here, I can try and like turn my whole computer.\nyeah. Alexa Deprisco: Can you see that. Andrew Ippolito: Yes, yes okay Oh, that is so cool Oh, and you have trees out your window, which is appropriate.\nAlexa Deprisco: yeah right. Alexa Deprisco: Very cool I can think about how it works.\nAndrew Ippolito: That is really cool. Andrew Ippolito: My friend Jen her her son. Andrew Ippolito: When he was really young men really he was like in first or second grade it was learning to do math and she found him underneath there a glass coffee table.\nAndrew Ippolito: And he was writing at the bottom of it and then he was getting up and looking down at it, he was doing like.\nAndrew Ippolito: he's like crazy smart, but he was using the two sides of the glass to who knows what he was thinking, but yeah he was she caught him on the floor writing up on the bottom of the glass.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, thanks for sure. Taylor Campbell: But let's see writing were like a marker. Andrew Ippolito: He was writing with with a marker yeah good thing was I don't you can take permanent marker off of glass to who knows what he was writing with I mean it could been crayon for all I know, but he was writing.\nTaylor Campbell: That wasn't really hard that's why i'm asking like that would take like a lot of pressure, like you, oh. yeah.\nTaylor Campbell: Man a pencil is just. Andrew Ippolito: know it was a marker so i'm kind it's bright colored colored markers.\nAndrew Ippolito: Might you know what my guess is it's probably the Expos like we're less was using because I imagine Jen my I know my friend well enough to she probably got him to stop to like be creative with it instead he was using it to his math.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah okay so anybody else questions on the light reactions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright Calvin cycle. Alexis Micewski: zoom in here to the Calvin cycle, the test, we need to know like how many carbons and how it changes."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 3) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/xKYNRAztGOU?si=7QlUgmJvZ-PiGwqW","chunkTitle":"The Calvin Cycle","chunkSummary":"Taylor Campbell asks Andrew Ippolito to explain the Calvin cycle.

Alexis Micewski: zoom in here to the Calvin cycle, the test, we need to know like how many carbons and how it changes.\nAndrew Ippolito: Exactly we're not we're not gonna. Andrew Ippolito: So there's a part of the Calvin cycle that you don't need to know actually know what in the PowerPoint there's there's a slide that says, you need to know this level of detail.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's basically here i'll draw what you need to know you got.\nAndrew Ippolito: me here, let me get i'll tell you what first let's do carbon accounting without without words one two so here one that's carbon dioxide Okay, let me get a second marker here setup.\nAndrew Ippolito: Plus. Andrew Ippolito: 12345 Okay, and what we're going to do a free gonna do is we're gonna pump those full of the energy that came from light reactions your your nav pH and your ATP we're going to use all that stuff to pump it in here.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and so step one is that fixation step that's grabbing the gas and making a solid basically fixing it in space and then we're going to reduce it we're going to pump the end of the pH in there.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, and we're going to get this very, very, very temporary six carbon intermediate that i'm going to draw and what that does is immediately breaks in half.\nAndrew Ippolito: To three carbon molecules.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, and so. Andrew Ippolito: That and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're going to do this, three times right so here, I can just take these watch this i'm going to just take those.\nAndrew Ippolito: That. Andrew Ippolito: are going to do it again. Andrew Ippolito: All right, and then what we did was we did we built up.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want to keep these together here we've built up 123456 of these okay so here that if you step back and think of it we've taken three carbon dioxide's.\nAndrew Ippolito: And in a series of chemical reactions we've stapled them onto these five carbon RU bps we pump them full of energy and we've created six of these G three piece.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what we're gonna do is we're going to take one of these.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna keep it for our trouble. Andrew Ippolito: we're just gonna keep him.\nKeep it. Andrew Ippolito: Right, the remaining ones.\nAndrew Ippolito: The rest of these guys. Andrew Ippolito: we're going to take them and now they're high in energy right, these are high energy three carbons we're going to take that energy that free energy and we're going to basically reconstruct these three.\nAndrew Ippolito: Groups, these three. Andrew Ippolito: are a big piece and that's that third step the regeneration step.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so step one is fixation we're going to take a five carbon molecule and staple it to a one carbon molecule okay does that so what's the enzyme that does that.\nAndrew Ippolito: Was the key player here. Andrew Ippolito: most abundant ends up on the planet.\nAndrew Ippolito: and also the stupidest.\nAngela Harbeck: pisco. Rebecca.\nAndrew Ippolito: If you read on the Internet, like I know and Wikipedia they they write it like this, capital or lowercase you capital be.\nAndrew Ippolito: lowercase I. Andrew Ippolito: lowercase s and then capital C and sometimes you see a slash with an o\nAndrew Ippolito: And the reason is that that it's not a acronym it's a word I can't remember that you take bits I like the word redux reduction oxidation crammed together right, this is, are you be right below this phosphate car box ELISE slash oxygen Nice.\nAndrew Ippolito: Because it's an enzyme that has two activities to enzymatic activity that's how we say we say activities, so you would say.\nAndrew Ippolito: Another enzyme that you've already I haven't taught you this word yet, but so any ends on that phosphor ELISE things is called a kinase right maybe you've raised an interesting that were before kindness anybody.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, you saw here first folks a kindness is an enzyme that as phosphates two things it's universal we're going to learn about kindness is all semester, so you might as well get that in your head now.\nAndrew Ippolito: A kinases and ends on the last four listings. Andrew Ippolito: And so, so like there's a glucose kinase there's those will see the word kindness and the next chapter.\nAndrew Ippolito: Anyway, we say kindness activity this isn't ends on the House kindness activity but it's how we talk so so rubbish go has both a car box ELISE activity and an oxygen as activity, it can use carbon dioxide and oxygen.\nAndrew Ippolito: interchangeably, and so we have to make sure the useful one, the one that we want to build things with is the car box last activity.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so we want to make sure that wherever obispo is doing its job it has more carbon dioxide available than oxygen, which is in our environment in our climate of the common default state in a temporary environment.\nAndrew Ippolito: But on a hot day when it's holding its breath and gas exchange isn't occurring the oxygen levels are gonna start creeping up.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right and so that's when you get that thing called photo respiration.\nAndrew Ippolito: And what photo respiration is is when rubbish go is using oxygen instead, and what that reaction looks like you don't have to worry about just understand it basically attacks the five carbon molecule and blows it up a little bit makes carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the idea is you can't regenerate. Andrew Ippolito: Okay you're tapping into your.\nAndrew Ippolito: That five carbon molecule pool right there you can think of the cells, having this reserve of these things, and so like think of a here's an analogy think of a trust fund.\nAndrew Ippolito: there's like a million dollars in the bank and that million dollars gives you know $2,000 a month in interest payments all right that's that that's we trust funds work you stick a whole bunch of money in the bank and you just live on the interest.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, the reason nice way for people to live if they're lucky enough to have some kind of rich relative that gives them a trust fund.\nAndrew Ippolito: So imagine that you have this life, where you get $2,000 a month, just because you're lucky, and you spend $2,000 a month.\nAndrew Ippolito: you're fine right that's that's what this would be like on a nice temporary day so so you you withdraw some money from it, but it just gets replaced to get it regenerates from the interest payments right.\nAndrew Ippolito: But let's say that you're greedy and you want to buy a tesla and so instead of $2,000 you take out $100,000.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well now, you have $900,000 in the bank and that's not going to support $2,000 a month anymore now you get only item is making this up now, you only get $1,800 a month.\nAndrew Ippolito: shucks. Andrew Ippolito: Right, but if you kept doing that eventually run out of money right, and so the idea here is photo respiration withdraws permanently some of that are a BP.\nAndrew Ippolito: You can't regenerate it, and so, if the cell starts using that up and that's all it's doing because it's hot out this elementary dies.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so that's where see for plants come in. Andrew Ippolito: what's the for plants do is they separate this step here the fixation step they separate that from the rest of us.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, so in see for plants. Andrew Ippolito: We do this in the medical field cells and instead of rubbish go, we have an enzyme called P P O box ELISE notice the name it's a car box ELISE it's not an oxygen as.\nAndrew Ippolito: It specialized. Andrew Ippolito: It it can pull a carbon dioxide out of the air, even if there's just one compared to the thousands of molecules of oxygen it doesn't compete with oxygen, and so it does not undergo photo respiration.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so what the sea for plants do is they take that carbon dioxide they put it onto a molecule called P P, as well as called P P O box at least P P, is a three carbon molecule.\nAndrew Ippolito: And increases for carbon molecule and a pumps, though, that into the bundle sheet cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: Where it then releases back into pvp and carbon dioxide and that's the key.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're pumping up the carbon dioxide concentration and the bundle she sells that's where rubbish go is so robust go still doing its thing it's just not initially fixing the carbon it's taking this carbon that's being given to it.\nAndrew Ippolito: And then everything else you already learned happens, meanwhile, that three carbon P P gets pumped back out to the medical field sales to pick up another carbon doubts.\nAndrew Ippolito: OK, so the key there to summarize it is see for plants.\nAndrew Ippolito: isolate the fixation step physically from the reduction and regeneration.\nAndrew Ippolito: In other words, you can you can there's a simple diagram I have a slide on this very simple diagram see three see for and again we haven't talked about camp.\nAndrew Ippolito: And you have the Calvin cycle step one step two and step three right, you have your you have your fixation your reduction in regeneration.\nAndrew Ippolito: Alright, and see three plants, they occur in all on the muscle cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: and see for plants that occurs in the medical field sales just step one and step, two and three occur and the boundaries T cells.\nAndrew Ippolito: And as you'll see in the camp plants this occurs during one time of the day, and this occurs in a second time of the day.\nAndrew Ippolito: So this is a space we separate things by space this separates and by time.\nAndrew Ippolito: Excuse me, yes. Alexa Deprisco: question about what you said when.\nAlexa Deprisco: The the sea for sugar from the C word plan is like pumped through to the bundle she sells and you said that it breaks up into the carbon dioxide.\nAlexa Deprisco: And the three carbons herbal it breaks off into like the carbon and the three carbon sugar and you had mentioned that the three carbon sugar, it was the pee pee but I thought the books that it was pirate movie and then like it reacts with ATP to turn back.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh that's me misspeaking it's. Andrew Ippolito: It says hi Ruby. Alexa Deprisco: that's an anomaly.\nAlexa Deprisco: It reacts with the ATP and then it becomes. Andrew Ippolito: yeah okay okay yeah so that's that's pie Ruby.\nAndrew Ippolito: becomes fastball email pie Ruby that's the key part, so the last piece of the pie Ruby and then that becomes the mouth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Again, so alexa this, this is a level of detail, you don't have to know for the test, but if you're learning it at this level that's good that's good then you'll get all the test questions right.\nAndrew Ippolito: So yeah I got I gloss over this, I mean actually there the other classes, they don't even teach the sea, for they just just teach the three so you guys are already ahead of the game in terms of knowing knowing some stuff for your future classes.\nAndrew Ippolito: You will learn about it, for, at some point in another class i'm not sure which class that will be I don't know if they cover they don't cover this and bio to you might cover this in biochemistry i'm not sure.\nAndrew Ippolito: In any case, um yeah so so the enzyme is PP car box ELISE and that takes the that creates malley as a final product.\nAndrew Ippolito: And so here here's your carbon dioxide on your pee pee and then this will all get pumped in.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it will release it. Andrew Ippolito: So you can picture we're building up the carbon dioxide here while this guy cycles to go back.\nAndrew Ippolito: let's go cycles to him.\nAngela Harbeck: I got a question. Angela Harbeck: yep so when you said that like when the GP G three peas, or like made and everything only one of them is captain, the other ones go back.\nAngela Harbeck: to hell isn't sugar made in the Calvin cycle, so how does the.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh okay so think of this disclosure out the height three phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: This is a try ios sugar. Andrew Ippolito: Is sugar.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, when we want to make glucose, we have to do all of this two times so to go Sir i'll have three phosphates generate one and we'll say glucose six phosphate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is glucose as far as we, for all intensive purposes so that's where like when we see sugar, this is what you're more familiar with their sure heck so sugar glucose.\nAndrew Ippolito: What Jay three P, is a sugar too it's just it's we don't do anything with it other than make other things with it so think of GDP is like the master Lego building block.\nAngela Harbeck: yeah but my question was like you said, we have to bring those back up so you could do carbon fixation again that you GDP So how do you how do they leave that Calvin cycle, then.\nAndrew Ippolito: Oh OK, so in order for the Calvin so it's a cycle right Calvin cycle, meaning that it keeps going it's not a flow it's a cycle, so in order to start the Calvin cycle, we need three molecules that are five carbons each these are also sugars, these are these are pintos sugars.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay called regulus right, you lose.\nAndrew Ippolito: This phosphate. Andrew Ippolito: So we're gonna take so let's do carbon accounting each one of these is five carpets right so that's 15 carbons total.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're gonna take. Andrew Ippolito: These 15 carbons and we're going to shuffle them around basically think of these as again think of it if you think of it as legos think about you have five three piece legos.\nAndrew Ippolito: we're going to shatter them all and we're going to reconstruct using the energy that was in there, to begin with three five carbon versions.\nAndrew Ippolito: And, and so we're going to take that last one for our trouble, and you can also visualize this as the three low energy carbon dioxide that have gotten reduced.\nAndrew Ippolito: These three right here. Andrew Ippolito: Leave the system and a higher energy state than they came in and the rest of it stays there.\nAngela Harbeck: Okay, that makes more sense. Andrew Ippolito: All right, more questions anybody.\nAndrew Ippolito: Otherwise i'll do cam. Andrew Ippolito: And then we'll do some respiration.\nAndrew Ippolito: and feel free you know if questions pop up as we're doing this just interrupt me and and and ask them right now to Camp plants can plants aren't so see three plants and see for plants are both named they're named after."},{"lectureTitle":"Lecture 9 (Part 3) - Photosynthesis","link":"https://youtu.be/xKYNRAztGOU?si=7QlUgmJvZ-PiGwqW","chunkTitle":"CAM Plants","chunkSummary":"Andrew Ippolito discusses CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants.

Andrew Ippolito: Right So these are, these are the survivors think of cam plants as sustenance farming, it is the least efficient mode of photosynthesis but it's the one that can survive in the hottest environments on earth.\nAndrew Ippolito: Let me think about it 120 degrees no water for weeks and there's this Green little plant growing.\nAndrew Ippolito: how to get there. Andrew Ippolito: Right so here's what they do now, in order to understand these best is, you have to think about the deserts like think about the desert day night cycle what's the desert like at night.\nAndrew Ippolito: very cold very cold. Andrew Ippolito: Anybody know why it's very cool, why is it that I mean you desert supposed to be hot, why are they so cold.\nTaylor Campbell: Well doesn't it not have anything really to like hold in the heat. Taylor Campbell: Exactly sand.\nAndrew Ippolito: silica has a very low specific heat if you've ever taken an aluminum pan out of your oven.\nAndrew Ippolito: you realize, maybe, surprisingly, the first time you do this, that it's cool to the touch, you can very easily hold the pan within seconds of it coming out of the oven.\nAndrew Ippolito: The reason for that is aluminum like silicon doesn't hold heat very long, it gives it back as fast as you take and contrast water when you give water he it keeps it.\nAndrew Ippolito: For a long time that's why everything that's me anything water beast takes a really long time to cool down that's why, if you've ever had.\nAndrew Ippolito: Ever ordered mashed potatoes or French Fries are made some and you're like Oh, they should be cool now and then you put in your mouth, you still bring your tongue.\nAndrew Ippolito: As because water has such a high specific key. Andrew Ippolito: The desert, all you got to stand right and so during the daytime, this is a desert during the daytime.\nAndrew Ippolito: That, so the sun's really hot because you're at the equator right, so you got maximum amount of energy coming down at you, at the same time.\nAndrew Ippolito: The sands giving back that he just as fast that's why it's so freaking hot during the day you got two sides of it right and that's why people that live in the desert where those robes you might wonder why they wear robes don't they overheat they're actually creating convection currents.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, the hot air comes up from the bottom of their robes and it leaves their sleeves in their hoods, and so there there's they're basically constantly have a fan going on that's how they keep cool.\nAndrew Ippolito: So during the day, you can imagine a cam plan okay so here's our cactus.\nAndrew Ippolito: The cam plant during the day to stone me.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or the stigmata. Andrew Ippolito: or shut to conserve water right they're holding their breath during the day.\nAndrew Ippolito: The light reactions are going, obviously the sun's out.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which means we're generating that ATP and that any dp.\nAndrew Ippolito: which we have to put to work, those are unstable molecules so we're gonna make sugars during the day.\nAndrew Ippolito: Well, how where's the see where's the CO2 coming from. Andrew Ippolito: Right remember the Calvin cycle needs a CO2, so it turns out, just like the sea floor plans we got the mallet.\nAndrew Ippolito: Somewhere so during the day there's this malley present that's getting degraded into carbon dioxide, just like the way they see three plants are doing.\nAndrew Ippolito: During the nighttime. Andrew Ippolito: In the desert so when the moon's out.\nAndrew Ippolito: And it's cold.\nAndrew Ippolito: At this point. Andrew Ippolito: there's tomato open.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they breathe in. Andrew Ippolito: breathe in that carbon dioxide.\nAndrew Ippolito: And they go through that P P car box ELISE.\nAndrew Ippolito: fixation. Andrew Ippolito: Okay, so a nighttime CO2 is fixed.\nAndrew Ippolito: The daytime everything else happens. Andrew Ippolito: that's it that's how that's the difference between the camp plants and the seaport plans.\nAndrew Ippolito: So the fun way to think about it, instead of separating in space they separated and time again they're separating step one from step, two and three of the Calvin cycle.\nAndrew Ippolito: And that's it. Andrew Ippolito: i'll leave it at that. Alexa Deprisco: This might be kind of a silly question, but like do you think then cam plans would fare better and more acidic soil.\nAndrew Ippolito: I want to say a first, not necessarily because they're still there, well.\nAndrew Ippolito: So a cactus plant is going to have lower efficiency is.\nAndrew Ippolito: yay. Andrew Ippolito: I never thought about this before lower so Mars I don't know the correlation between acidic soils.\nAndrew Ippolito: And plant growth because there are like we're going to genetics and a couple weeks and we're going to see that some treats are environmentally driven and so there's a type of flowering plant.\nAndrew Ippolito: I can't remember the name of it yeah Thank you. Andrew Ippolito: hydrangeas hydrangeas in acidic soil give you a.\nAndrew Ippolito: pink flowers and then basic soils give you yeah blue flowers, but they can survive in both so I don't know necessarily.\nAndrew Ippolito: If I had to guess the campus probably be fine in acidic soil more acidic soils because they're harder they they can keep the water there succulents right they can drop the water in there, but that's just a guess and what's your brain doing what do you thinking about.\nAlexa Deprisco: Just because i'm like reading in the book it said it was like incorporating like these organic acids like that's where it was fixing its carbon and then the breakdown of that was like releasing the CO2 so i'm like if there's like more acid pair with.\nAndrew Ippolito: The because of the name, so yeah, so I think I think we're talking also about Rubik acid.\nAndrew Ippolito: Which is really what I read is there's Peruvian pi river gas or they're just just like citric acid and citrate.\nAndrew Ippolito: Their contract Member I don't know your chemistry it you conjugate acids contract basis that you do that yet.\nAndrew Ippolito: yeah so yeah we remember how we talked about acids donating protons and basis absorbing it yeah so.\nAndrew Ippolito: Any one of those molecules that's weak like carbonic acid, you can think of it as there's two states have it like in redux right so it's either goddess proton or does.\nAndrew Ippolito: Right, and so you have those two states, and so, once called the conjugate acid one's called the contract of bees, just like one is the oxidized form and then reduce for.\nAndrew Ippolito: Or the first formulated for them than office for late for all these things that we talked about have different states and re ATP ATP any dp and then the pH and so Peruvian pie Rubik acid citrate citric acid, those are they're all like a yin Yang sort of thing.\nAndrew Ippolito: So terrific acid is it's I mean yes it's an acid it's donating protons, but that is all that means is that when you put it in water it loses a proton it doesn't mean it's dropping a pH, to the point where it's dangerous.\nAndrew Ippolito: It just means it's under seven, it might be 6.9 that's still technically a weak acid right but that's well within the physiological limits of anything to live.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, good question any other questions.\nAndrew Ippolito: Okay, all right, so what we're going to do now is i'm going to stop this PowerPoint this are the the recording, this is the end of like the review for photosynthesis so tag this as.\nAndrew Ippolito: A photosynthesis lecture because I don't want to I don't want to contaminate it with some cell respiration talk we're going to stop this recording here."}]
